### What is Sync?

Sync (or synchronisation) is the process of ensuring that data across all connected devices or systems is consistent and up-to-date. This helps users in different locations or on different devices access the most current data without discrepancies. Proper syncing ensures smooth operations, especially in systems where real-time data is crucial.

### Why Sync is Important?

Syncing is essential because it:

- ***Ensures Consistency:*** Keeps local and central data in sync, so everyone is working with the same, up-to-date information.

- ***Improves Efficiency:*** Eliminates the need for manual data entry or error-checking, ensuring real-time data is available to all users.

- ***Facilitates Collaboration:*** Enables teams at different sites or using different devices to work together seamlessly, without worrying about outdated data.

- ***Supports Remote Work:*** Allows remote teams or field staff to stay connected to the main system, ensuring they can access and update accurate data on-demand.

## Working Offline

Offline functionality ensures that users can remain productive even in areas with unreliable or no internet access. This is crucial in environments like remote healthcare facilities or field operations, where connectivity may be intermittent. By allowing users to continue working offline, the system prevents disruptions and data loss. 

### How It Works:

- ***Offline Mode:*** When you're offline, the system saves your data locally on your device. You can perform tasks such as adding new records, updating inventory, or making orders, just like when you're connected.

- ***Syncing When Back Online:*** Once the device reconnects to the internet, the system automatically syncs all changes made offline with the central database. Any updates made during offline mode will be pushed to the server, and changes made by others while you were offline will be pulled down to your device.
