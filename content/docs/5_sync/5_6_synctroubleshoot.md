If you are experiencing issues with sync, here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Your Internet Connection**  
   The most common issue with sync failures is a lack of a stable internet connection. Ensure that your device is properly connected to the internet and that the connection is stable.

2. **Try a Different Connection**  
   If your current internet connection is weak or unstable, try switching to a different network, such as using a mobile hotspot, to see if that resolves the issue.

3. **Still Not Working? Contact Support**  
   If you've checked your connection and tried using an alternative network but the sync is still not working, please contact our support team for further assistance. You can reach us at [support@msupply.foundation](mailto:support@msupply.foundation).
