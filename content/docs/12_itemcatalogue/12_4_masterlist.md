### What is a Master List?

**Master Lists** are standard lists of items that you supply to wards, clinics, and other facilities on a regular basis. Once you create a Master List, you can assign it to the customers or stores that you supply. It helps with managing stock and making sure that the right items are always available, including for regular orders.

Master Lists are especially useful for stores that supply many customers or stores with similar or identical stock items. It makes managing and tracking inventory easier, as you don't have to create new lists for each customer or store â€“ you just use the same list.


## Viewing Master Lists
