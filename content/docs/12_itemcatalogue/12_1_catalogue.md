The **Catalogue** is a central list of all items, assets, and master lists available to your store. It offers an organized view of resources, allowing users to easily access available items, whether in stock or in use. If an item is not in the catalogue, it cannot be ordered or managed directly. In such cases, you will need to request the Central Store to add the item to a master list, making it visible and available for your store.

You will notice there is also an **Asset** section under **Catalogue**. This is used for the GAPS functionality for managing Cold Chain equipment. The assets have been predetermined by the [WHO PQS Catalogue](https://apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/) (sections E003 & E004).
