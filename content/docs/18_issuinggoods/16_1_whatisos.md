### What are Outbound Shipments?

**Outbound Shipments** refer to the process of sending goods from your store or facility to customers, other stores, or distribution points. Once a requisition is processed and the items are ready for delivery, they are packaged and shipped as outbound shipments. This step ensures that inventory is distributed according to orders and that the right items reach their intended destination.

For more details on how this process fits into the broader supply chain, refer to the [Supply Chain Overview](/docs/11_terminologyprocess/11-2-supplychainoverview/).
