| **Term**  | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Items         | Products managed in mSupply (includes medicines, consumables, equipment, laboratory/radiology items, and larger assets such as vehicles and furniture).                                                                                                                                                         |
| Stores        | Departments within a facility who may or may not manage inventory independently from a larger entity. For example, there may be two stores in a hospital - one inpatient pharmacy store and one outpatient pharmacy store.                                                                                 |
| Locations     | Specific place inside a store where items are kept. For example, a large central warehouse may have many locations (e.g. A.02.04, B.01.03), while small stores may have less (e.g. Room 1, Room 2). Items may also be stored without assigning a location (i.e., just stored alphabetically).             |
| Suppliers     | Suppliers are facilities that a store orders or receives stock from. Suppliers may be external (e.g. private drug companies or wholesalers) or internal (e.g. central medical store, provincial warehouses).                                                                                               |
| Donors        | External entities who pay for donated stock (e.g. UNICEF, USAID). No donor is entered when the government or medical store is paying in a normal financial transaction. When the donor is recorded, you can track donated items through the supply chain and run donor transaction reports and stocktakes. |
| Customers     | Recipients of items, excluding patients. This includes health centres, hospitals, wards, private clinics and pharmacies, outreach services and any other entity that an mSupply store issues stock to.                                                                                                     |
| Patients      | Individuals who receive items from a prescription. When a store uses mSupply in dispensary mode, patients receive unique ID numbers and we can track their prescription history, allergies, payment history, insurers, and notes.                          |
| Prescribers   | Prescribers are authorised medical professionals who provide prescriptions to patients, which we can dispense in mSupply. Prescribers may include doctors, nurses and other authorised individuals. |
| Users         | Users are the people using mSupply (you!). Each user has their own password and set of permissions (which can vary from store to store). System logs track everything that users do in mSupply.                                                                                   |
