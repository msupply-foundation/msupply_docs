### What is Distribution?

**Distribution** refers to the process of delivering goods from your store or facility to customers or other locations. This process includes activities such as managing order requests (requisitions), preparing goods for delivery, and ensuring the products reach the right destinations in a timely and accurate manner. Effective distribution helps ensure that inventory is available where needed, reducing delays and improving customer satisfaction.

### What is a Requisition?

A **Requisition** is a request for goods or supplies, typically made by customers. When a customer orders stock from you, they create and send an **Internal Order** in their store which will appear as a **Requisition** in your store.

For more details on how this process fits into the broader supply chain, refer to the [Supply Chain Overview](/docs/11_terminologyprocess/11-2-supplychainoverview/).
