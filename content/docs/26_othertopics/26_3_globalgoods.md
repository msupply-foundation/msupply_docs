### What are Global Goods?

**Global Goods** are products and tools that are designed to improve public health on a global scale. These goods are typically open-source, meaning they can be accessed and adapted by anyone, anywhere. They are created with the goal of addressing public health challenges, particularly in low-resource settings, and ensuring that vital healthcare tools and services reach everyone, no matter where they are.

**Open mSupply** is proud to be recognized as a **Global Good**. As a tool designed to manage and track critical supplies like medicines, vaccines, and medical equipment, Open mSupply plays a key role in ensuring these essential items are available where they are most needed. By improving the efficiency and transparency of supply chains, Open mSupply contributes to making healthcare more accessible and equitable.
