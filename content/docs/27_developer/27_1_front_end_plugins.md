We intend to build a separate developer documentation web site, but we wanted to make this information findable until we do that, so it lives here:

## Why Plugins?

Plugins allow you to add functionality to Open mSupply without having to modify the main code base.

## Documentation

Our Github repository has a full explanation of how to make front-end plugins [here](https://github.com/msupply-foundation/open-msupply/blob/develop/client/packages/plugins/README.md)

## Examples

Example plugins can be found in the examples folder [here](https://github.com/msupply-foundation/open-msupply-plugins)
