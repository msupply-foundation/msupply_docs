In the Android App you'll see a section that allows you to change the mode between client and server, and to view the log file:

![Mobile settings](/docs/introduction/images/mobile_settings.png)

Click on the `View` button to open a window which displays the server log:

![Mobile log viewer](/docs/introduction/images/mobile_view_log.png)

From here you can save the log as a text file to your device: simply click `Save` and choose a location to save the file.
