Patients can be added and their information edited from this page. The Patient information page is highly customisable and can be tailored to specific programs. Please see [Programs](/docs/programs/patients) for more information.

### Viewing Patients

To use patients, ensure that your store is set to `Dispensary` mode (see the [virtual stores](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:virtual_stores#store_type) documentation for how to do this).

### Open the Patient Menu

Click on `Dispensary` > `Patients` in the navigation panel. 

![dispensary menu](/docs/dispensary/images/dispensary_menu.png)

You will be presented with a list of patients visible to your store.

### Patient List

The list of patients is divided into 8 columns: 

| Column      | Description                         |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Patient ID**    | The ID of the patient                |
| **NUIC**  | National unique identifier code  |
| **First name**  | First name  |
| **Last name**  | Last name  |
| **Gender** | Gender | 
| **Date of Birth**  | The patient's date of birth  |
| **Deceased** | Whether the patient is deceased  |

2. The list can display a fixed number of patients per page. On the bottom left corner, you can see how many patients are currently displayed on your screen.

### Filter Patients

You can filter the list of patients by using the search bar at the top of the page. This can be useful if you are looking for a specific patient. By default, the search bar will contain the filters for: First name, Last name, and Patient ID.

For example, to filter by gender, click on the `Filters`, select `Gender`, and then select which gender you would like to filter by.

### Exporting Patients 

The list of Patients can be exported to a comma separated file (csv). Simply click the export button (on the right, at the top of the page)

![Export button](/docs/distribution/images/export.png)

and the file will be downloaded. The export function will download all Patients, not just the current page, if you have more than 20 of them.

### Creating a New Patient

A new window will appear for you to enter the patient's details. You must enter the patient's code, first name and last name to enable to `Ok & Next` button. If you do not wish to enter the patient's real name, you can use a pseudonym.

![New Patient](/docs/dispensary/images/patient_new.png)

If you have a patient or patients matching the name you have entered, you will be prompted to select the patient in the new window. 

![New Patient](/docs/dispensary/images/patient_search.png)

Clicking on the matching patient will re-direct you to the patient's details page.

However, if you have no matching patients or if you wish to create a new patient with the same details as an existing patient, you can click the `Ok & Next` button to be re-directed to the patient's details page where you can create the patient.

Then click the `Create` button at the bottom right of the page to create the patient.
