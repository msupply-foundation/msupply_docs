Patients can be added and their information edited from this page.

### Patients

To use patients, ensure that your store is set to `Dispensary` mode (see the [virtual stores](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:virtual_stores#store_type) documentation for how to do this).

### Open the Patient Menu

Click on `Dispensary` > `Patients` in the navigation panel.

![dispensary menu](/docs/dispensary/images/dispensary_menu.png)

You will be presented with a list of patients visible to your store.

### Patient List

![](/docs/dispensary/images/patient-list-view.png)

1. The list of patients is divided into 8 columns:

| Column            | Description                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Patient ID**    | The ID of the patient            |
| **NUIC**          | National unique identifier code  |
| **Created**       | The date the patient was created |
| **First name**    | First name                       |
| **Last name**     | Last name                        |
| **Gender**        | Gender                           |
| **Date of Birth** | The patient's date of birth      |
| **Deceased**      | Whether the patient is deceased  |

2. The list can display a fixed number of patients per page. On the bottom left corner, you can see how many patients are currently displayed on your screen.

### Filter Patients

You can filter the list of patients by using the search bar at the top of the page. This can be useful if you are looking for a specific patient. By default, the search bar will contain the filters for: First name, Last name, and Patient ID.

![Patient filter](/docs/dispensary/images/patient_filter.png)

For example, to filter by gender, click on the `Filters`, select `Gender`, and then select which gender you would like to filter by.

### Exporting Patients

The list of Patients can be exported to a comma separated file (csv). Simply click the export button (on the right, at the top of the page)

![Export button](/docs/distribution/images/export.png)

and the file will be downloaded. The export function will download all Patients, not just the current page, if you have more than 20 of them.

### Creating a New Patient

Press on the `New Patient` button in the top right corner.

A new window will appear for you to enter the patient's details. You must enter the patient's code, first name and last name to enable to `Ok & Next` button. If you do not wish to enter the patient's real name, you can use a pseudonym.

![New Patient](/docs/dispensary/images/patient_new.png)

If you have a patient or patients matching the name you have entered, you will be prompted to select the patient in the new window.

![New Patient](/docs/dispensary/images/patient_search.png)

Clicking on the matching patient will re-direct you to the patient's details page.

However, if you have no matching patients or if you wish to create a new patient with the same details as an existing patient, you can click the `Ok & Next` button to be re-directed to the patient's details page where you can create the patient.

Then click the `Create` button at the bottom right of the page to create the patient.

### Edit a Patient

To edit a patient, click on the patient's name in the list of patients.

If there is more data in your Patient view, it's likely due to Patient Programs being configured. You can find out more in the [Patient Programs](/docs/programs/program-module) documentation.
