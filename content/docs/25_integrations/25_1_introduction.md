### What is Integration?

**Integration** refers to the ability of Open mSupply to connect and interact with other systems and platforms, enabling seamless data exchange and improving overall functionality. 

By integrating with external tools, databases, or services, Open mSupply ensures that critical information flows smoothly across different healthcare systems, providing a unified and efficient approach to managing inventory, patient data, and other essential processes.

Through integration, Open mSupply can synchronize data with national health systems, electronic medical records (EMRs), and other third-party applications, ensuring that all relevant data is up-to-date and accessible in real-time. 

This enhances decision-making, reduces manual data entry, and helps streamline operations for better patient care and inventory management.
