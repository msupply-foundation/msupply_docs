We also offer:

What We Provide:

- Help with “How do I ….. ?” questions.
- Assistance if you think things aren’t working correctly.
- Installation of updates.
- Backups of your data to our cloud storage.

We aim to give a first response to all support requests within **4 working hours**, using working hours in Nepal (10am-6pm Nepal time). In reality, we have much longer working hours and can respond outside of Nepal working hours, thanks to our offices in New Zealand and staff in the UK.

#### ***mSupply Up-to-Date Program***

Our **Up-to-Date program** provides you with the latest versions of mSupply for a fixed yearly fee. New versions include:

- Updates to the underlying database system for compatibility with new versions of **Windows** and **MacOS** as they are released.
- Performance improvements or new capabilities in the database system. (For example, in 2018, we installed 64-bit versions of mSupply that made many operations, such as long reports, ten times faster than before.)
- New features in Open mSupply - our version history is here: [Open mSupply Version History](https://msupply.foundation/open-msupply/releases)
- Bug fixes.

Members of our **mSupply Up-to-Date program** have their feature requests treated with priority. If these features are applicable to a wide user base, they are often included at no extra charge.
