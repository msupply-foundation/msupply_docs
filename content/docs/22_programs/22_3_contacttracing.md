### Contact tracing

Contact tracing is the process of identifying people who might have been exposed to a disease through the patient. The contact can then be contacted, registered and enrolled into a matching program if needed.

#### Add a Contact

To add a contact for a patient, click the `Add Contact` button on the top right corner of the screen. Click on the down arrow next to the button and select `Add Contact` if the button does not say `Add Contact`.

A window will open, inviting you to select the type of contact you want to add. Currently, only HIV Partner Testing is available. Click Ok to proceed.

#### Linking a Contact to a Patient

Once a contact has been added to mSupply, they can then be linked to patient who came into contact with them. Do this by clicking the `Link to Patient` button on the top right of the screen.

This will open a search window where you can search for the patient you want by their first name, last name or patient ID. Once you have found the patient, click on the patient to link them to the contact.

If the patient is already linked to the contact, but you want to change the patient because you linked the wrong patient, click the `Unlink Patient` button on the top right of the screen.
