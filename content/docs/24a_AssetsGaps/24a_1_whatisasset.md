Assets in Open mSupply is a digital register to manage the creation and maintenance of assets.

The asset catalogue provides a list of base asset items, and is pre-populated from the [WHO PQS Catalogue](https://apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/) (sections E003 & E004). You can then create an asset based on the items in this catalogue using the [Equipment](/docs/24b_coldchain/24-5-equipment/) section. Doing so will give you base information, such as the manufacturer & model of an asset without having to enter that manually.
From the **Assets** menu, you can view all of the assets currently in your store.
