### Managing status log reasons

<div class="note">Status log reasons are managed from the <a href="/docs/getting_started/central">Open mSupply central server</a>.</div>

When users add a new status log against a particular asset, more detail can be provided with a reason associated with the new status. For example, an asset which has been labled `NON_FUNCTIONING` could be assigned a reason of `power supply broken`. These reasons are customisable, and associated with a particular status.

Reasons can be managed on a new page accessible from the `Manage Log Reasons` button.

On this page you can:

- Create new log reasons through the `Create log reason` button

This will open a create new reason modal
