### Keyboard shortcuts

There are keyboard shortcuts used throughout Open mSupply. Rather than remember them all, to get started you simply have to remember the combination `control (ctrl)`+`k` (windows and linux) or `cmd (âŒ˜)`+`k` (mac)

This will bring up the following window, no matter which page you are on:

This shows you the list of globally available shortcuts, for example pressing `d` on your keyboard will take you to the dashboard (unless you are entering text into an input field!).

However, you can also click on an item in the list, or search available commands:

In addition - there are various places where specific keyboard shortcuts are available. An example is the tab control used in both Stocktakes and Inbound Shipments. Here you can use `control`+`1` to navigate to the first tab (Quantities) or `control`+`2` for the second tab (Pricing) etc. If you press `+` on your keyboard, you can add a new batch.
