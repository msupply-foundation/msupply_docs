Creating a New Patient 

mSupply can create a patient file that will hold all the necessary information to dispense medicine(s) to. To create a new patient file, click on 'dispensary' and then the 'patients' icon from the Dashboard:

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Access_Patient.png)


This will bring up the 'Patient' page. To input the information of a new patient into mSupply, click on the 'New Patient' button. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/New_Patient.png)

Here you will find the option to search for an existing patient so you can dispense the necessary medicine to the correct patient, and the information will be documented and inform mSupply. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Patient_Details.png)

Click 'OK & Next' to bring up all matching criteria, such as in the example below:

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Matching_Patients.png)

To create a new patient, simply place all the relevent information of the patient in the 'New Patient' tab. Thsi will bring up the option to include the name, date of birth and national health ID among other details. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Patient_Details.png)

The information can now be used to find the patient file at a later date. After clicking on the 'OK & Next' you can then access the 'Create' option, that will transfer all the information previously input into a new tab that allows/requires more detail:

Searching for a Patient 

When in the 'Dispensary' menu a comprehensive list of exisitng patients will appear. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Search_Patient.png)

Clicking on a patient name will bring up the patient's details.

In the same 'Patient' menu, search bars are above the patient list that can be used to narrow and specify the search. You can search by both first and last name as well as by ID. This can be useful to quickly find patients with common names or if there is a large number of existing patients. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Narrow_Search_Patient.png)

Finding Patient Details 

Clicking on a patient file (in the 'Patient' tab) will automatically link to the personal details of the patient. The 'Program' and 'Encounter' history can be found in the same section.

Export Patient List

mSupply allows the option of exporting patient data to be sent to a non-mSupply user. This will begin the download of an excel file with the basic details of patients:

1) First name
2) Last name
3) National ID

This can be done by clicking on the 'Export' option in the corner of the main 'Patient' menu. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Export_Patients.png)

Add Program

mSupply allows patients to be enrolled in a program relevent to the intervention and the patient's illness. This can be done through the 'Patient' tab or while creating a new patient. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Add_Program.png)

Programs are customizable and specific to each context and country - the following examples are from the HIV intervention in Papua New Guinea. This means that each program and the details required will be different for each mSupply user. 

If there is more than one program avaible, all the options will appear with the specific programs the patient is enrolled in ticked and grey. 

If you would like to enroll the highlighted patient in another program, you can do so from this menu.

Encounters

An 'Encounter' is the recorded visit of a patient, and their treatment, under a specific program.  

NOTE: You cannot record and encounter without a patient enrolled in a program - however this may change in future implementation of mSupply

Under the 'Dispensary' category there is the 'Encounters' tab. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/programs/images/Encounters_Tab.png)

Clicking on this will bring up a list of patients and every encounter that has been documented on mSupply. This includes the date, status and program.

NOTE: A patient must have to be enrolled in a program to input an encounter

After clicking on a patient in the 'Encounter' tab, it will bring up a panel of
