Program Indicators are essentially sets of configurable survey questions that can be answered as part of a program requisition. They are recorded against the period that the program requisition is created for and used in reporting.

## Enabling Program Indicators

Program Indicators are configured on the mSupply Primary Server, following the documenation [here](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/items:programs#adding_indicators_to_a_program).

## Manual Customer Requisitions

Manual Customer Requisitions can be made to other stores as a fallback if device that store is meant to be active on is no longer operational.

1. Create a manual requisition to another store as described [here](/docs/distribution/requisitions/#manual-requisition)
2. Click on the Indicators tab

3. Click on one of the Program Indicator buttons

From here you can enter in the data entry configured for each indicator configured for this program.
