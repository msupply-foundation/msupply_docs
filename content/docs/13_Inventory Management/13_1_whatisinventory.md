### What is Your Inventory?

Your **inventory** refers to the stock of items that your store or facility currently has on hand. 

Managing your inventory ensures that you always have the right items available when needed, helping to avoid stockouts or overstocking. It is a key part of maintaining efficient operations and ensuring that your store can meet the needs of your customers or internal operations.

#### ***Location***

**Location** refers to the specific areas within your store or facility where inventory is kept. This could include different rooms, shelves, or sections within a warehouse or smaller store. Organizing your inventory by location ensures that items are easy to find, reducing the time spent searching for products and improving overall efficiency.

#### ***View Stock***

The **View Stock** section allows you to see the current stock levels of items in your store. You can quickly check the availability of products, the quantity on hand, and additional details such as item descriptions, expiries, or where it's kept.

#### ***Stocktake***

A **Stocktake** is a process of physically counting the items in your store to ensure that your recorded stock levels match the actual inventory. Regular stocktakes are essential for maintaining accurate records, identifying discrepancies, and ensuring efficient stock management. The **Stocktake** feature allows you to generate stocktake sheets, perform counts, and update the system with the correct stock levels.

With stocktake functionality, you can ensure your records are up-to-date, which is crucial for effective inventory management and avoiding potential issues like stockouts or excess inventory.
