## If you are unable to connect to the server on your machine
If you have installed Open mSupply client or standalone on your machine, but are unable to connect to the server, try the following steps: 

1. Check the name of the computer. If you are on a Windows machine, this can generally be found by going through the Control Panel > System and Security > System. Change the PC name to ensure it does not have any special characters and is not very long. Restart the computer and try connecting again. 
2. If the step above doesn't work, you may need to install a network loopback adaptor on your computer using [these instructions](https://techhub.hpe.com/eginfolib/networking/docs/sdn/sdnc2_5/5998-7318prog/content/s_sdnc-dev-nw-adapter-install.html).
