## Viewing the synchronisation settings

To view the synchronisation settings, go to `Admin` in the lower section of the navigation panel: 

![admin: nav](/docs/administration/images/admin_nav.png)

You will see the synchronisation section below the display settings, click on this to view the options.

![admin: page](/docs/administration/images/administration.png)

## Updating settings

Be very careful updating these settings! They control how the server connects to the central server and do not usually need to be changed. If you make any changes without consulting the administrator of the central server, it is very likely that you will break the sync connection.
