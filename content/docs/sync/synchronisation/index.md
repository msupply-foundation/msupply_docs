## Viewing the synchronisation status

To view the synchronisation status, click `Sync` in the lower section of the navigation panel or press CTRL+ALT+S (CTRL+OPT+S if using a mac) on your keyboard:

![sync: nav](../images/sync_nav.png)

The window shows the number of records waiting to be pushed to the central servers, and the time that the last sync happened.

![sync: status](images/sync_status.png)

As of v2.0.0, your Open mSupply server actually syncs to two central servers! The `Push V6` and `Pull V6` steps transfer data to and from the Open mSupply central server, which you can read more about [here](../../getting_started/central-server). The `Push`, `Pull Central` and `Pull Remote` steps are syncing with an mSupply central server.

To close the window you can press `Esc` on your keyboard or click the close button which is at the top right:

## Manual synchronisation

On this (sync) screen you are also able to initiate synchronisation immediately rather than wait for the scheduled time ( remember, the sync interval is configured in the Admin > Synchronisation section, see the [Settings](/docs/settings/synchronisation/) page for details ).

To start sync manually, simply click the `Sync now!` button. When you do, you'll see that the button changes to a spinner and the progress is indicated with the stepper icons which change to show which step is currently active. For example, in the image below you'll see that the `Push` step is active.

You'll notice the totals below the `Push V6` and `Push` steps - this is the number of changes to be _processed_ by each step.

The records will then be pushed to _either_ the Open mSupply central server (V6) or the mSupply central server, but they need to be processed before they know where to go!

So in the above example, 4 sync records are being sent in total, not 8.

If any errors are encountered during the sync progress you will see these on this screen too. Hover over the `i` icon to see additional details.

## Server details

At the top right of the `Settings` page the current server URL is displayed, along with a QR code. The code contains the server URL and can be used to easily configure [mSupply Cold Chain](/coldchain/introduction/) when synchronising with Open mSupply.

If you are having trouble scanning the code, you can click (or press, if using a tablet) the code to display a larger version.
