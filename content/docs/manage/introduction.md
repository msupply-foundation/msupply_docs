The `Manage` section is only available when you are logged in on the [Open mSupply Central Server](/docs/getting_started/central). This is where you can access and edit centrally managed data.

## Configuration

Currently, `Manage` features are only enabled as part of the `Vaccine` module.

To begin, enable the store preference for `mobile: Uses Vaccine Module` (see the [store preferences](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:virtual_stores#preferences_tab) documentation for how to do this).
