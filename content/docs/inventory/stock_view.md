One of the most important - but easiest - tasks in mSupply is to check how much stock you have on hand. When you create an Outbound Shipment and add an item, mSupply will tell you if you have enough stock. But at many other times, you might want to quickly check, and it is very simple to do so.

## Viewing stock

In the navigation panel, Go to `Inventory` and tap on the `Stock` submenu:

![Stock: nav](/docs/inventory/images/stock_gotostock.png)

A detailed list of your inventory appears:

![Stock: list](/docs/inventory/images/stock_viewstock.png)

The list is divided into 8 columns:

| Column        | Description                                              |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code**      | Code assigned to this item in mSupply                    |
| **Name**      | This is the name by which mSupply will refer to the item |
| **Batch**     | Batch number of the stock line                           |
| **Expiry**    | Expiry date of the batch                                 |
| **Location**  | Where the item is being stored in your facility          |
| **Pack Size** | The pack size of the item                                |
| **Pack Qty**  | Number of packs available in your store                  |
| **SOH**       | The total quantity of stock on hand, in number of packs  |
| **Supplier**  | Shows the source of this stock item                      |

### Exporting Stock

The list of Stock can be exported to a comma separated file (csv). Simply click the export button (on the right, at the top of the page)

![Export button](/docs/inventory/images/export.png)

and the file will be downloaded. The export function will download all stock lines, not just the current page, if you have more than 20 of them.

## Looking for a specific item

You can filter the list by item name or code, location or by expiry. This can be useful if you're looking for one particular item.

![Stock: filter](/docs/inventory/images/stock_filter.png)

Click on the `Filters` to show the available filters, select an option, for example `Code or Name`, and type as much of an item name or code in the `Code or Name` field:

## Editing a stock line

Clicking on a line in the list will open the edit screen. Here, you can change the properties of this stock line.

![Edit stock line](/docs/inventory/images/stock_edit_line.png)

To see changes made to this stock line, you can click the `Log` tab. Note that you might have to scroll to the right in order to see all of the details!

![Stock line log 1](/docs/inventory/images/stock_line_edit_log_1.png)

<div class="imagetitle" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Log, showing changes made to this item</div>

![Stock line log 2](/docs/inventory/images/stock_line_edit_log_2.png)

<div class="imagetitle">With the log scrolled to the right</div>

## Updating barcode

This feature is available when running either the android or desktop versions of Open mSupply.
There is an additional button shown when editing a stock line:

![Scan button](/docs/inventory/images/stock-line-edit-scan.png)

Clicking this will start the barcode scanner - if one is attached, when running desktop. If running on android, the camera on the device is used.
If a barcode is scanned successfully, then the barcode field is populated with the scanned value. If a QR code which has a batch and expiry information is scanned, then these fields on the stock edit window are also populated from the scanned code.

<div class="tip">You can also press the 'control (ctrl)' and 's' keys at the same time to start the barcode scanner</div>

Once you have updated the barcode, this code is associated with the item, for this particular pack size. This item will now be automatically detected when adding items to an Outbound Shipment using a barcode scanner.

Barcodes updated in this way will also synchronised with other stores, which means that codes you scan here will allow other stores to automatically add these items to Outbound Shipments using a barcode scanner.

## Repacking stock

The repack feature gives us the ability to break down stock into smaller pack sizes, consolidate it into larger pack sizes or move part or all of a stock line to a new location. Here's how to use it:

In the list showing all current stock, there is a column on the far left, titled `Repack`. To repack a stock item, click the repack icon for that line, like so:

![Stock list view showing repack button](/docs/inventory/images/stock-list-view-repack.png)

To begin with, the stock line won't have any repacks showing, so you'll see a window like this:

![Repack window with no repacks](/docs/inventory/images/repack-no-repacks.png)

Click the `New` button to start a repack:

![Repack entry form](/docs/inventory/images/repack-enter.png)

From here, you can enter the number of packs which you'd like to repack, up to a maximum of the current number of packs in stock. This number is the number shown next to `Packs available` - in this case there are 779 packs available.

You can then enter a new pack size, and optionally, enter a location for the new stock. The `New number of packs` is calculated automatically.
Click `Save` to save the changes. Clicking `Print` will allow you to print details of this repack action.

The repacks made from this stock item are shown in a list:

![Repack list](/docs/inventory/images/repack-list.png)

Clicking on one of the lines will show details of the repack, and allow printing of it:
