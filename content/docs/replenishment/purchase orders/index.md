Purchase Orders can be used to order stock from external suppliers.

## Preferences

### Use Purchase Orders

In order to use purchase orders you need to have the [Use procurement functionality](/docs/manage/facilities/#store-preferences) store preference enabled for your store.

![Store preference](images/po_store_pref.png)

### Authorise Purchase Orders

Authorisation is required if the [Global preference](/docs/manage/global-preferences/) `Authorise Purchase Orders` is enabled.

When enabled, the next purchase order status after `New` is `Ready for Approval`. Only an user with authorisation permissions can confirm proceeding to the next status, `Ready for Sending`.

## Permissions

### Authorise Purchase Orders

Any users who should be able to authorise purchase orders should have the [user permission](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/admin:managing_users#permissions_tabs) `Authorise purchase orders` enabled.

Having this permission enabled will allow the user to proceed the purchase order status from `Ready for Approval` to `Ready for Sending` if authorisation is required.

It also allows the user to edit the `Adjusted packs` value after the purchase order is at `Ready for Sending` status or further. Users without permission are unable to edit this field.

## Viewing Purchase Orders

### Go to the Purchase Orders Menu

First you need to have purchase orders enabled for your store.

1. Go to the [Manage](/docs/manage/facilities/#store-preferences) menu in the navigation panel
2. Click on `Stores`, then select your store
3. In the `Preferences` section, enable `Use procurement functionality`

Now you will be able to access the **Purchase Order** menu:

![Go to Purchase Orders](images/po_navigation.png)

1. Go to the `Replenishment` menu in the navigation panel
2. Click on `Purchase Orders`

### Purchase Orders list

The first thing you see is a list of existing Purchase Orders.

The Purchase Orders list is divided into the following columns:

| Column                 | Description                           |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Supplier**           | Name of the Supplier                  |
| **Number**             | Purchase Order Number                 |
| **Created**            | Created date                          |
| **Confirmed**          | Confirmed date                        |

### Filter Purchase Orders

You can filter the list of purchase orders by supplier, status, confirmed date, requested delivery date, and sent date. This can be useful if you're looking for one particular order!

![Purchase Orders filter](images/po_filter.png)

For example, to filter by supplier name, click on Filters, select `Supplier` and start typing some or all of a supplier name in the `Supplier` field. All the purchase orders for this supplier will appear in the list.

![Filtered results](images/po_filtered.png)

### Exporting Purchase Orders

The list of Purchase Orders can be exported to a comma separated file (csv). Simply click the export button (on the right, at the top of the page) and the file will be downloaded.

![Export button](images/po_export.png)

The export function will download all Purchase Orders, not just the current page, if you have more than 20 of them.

### Delete a Purchase Order

You can delete an order from the Purchase Order list.

1. Select the purchase order that you want to delete by checking the box on the left end of the list. You can select more than one purchase order to be deleted. You can even select them all using the master checkbox in the list headers.

2. The `Actions` footer will display at the bottom of the screen when a purchase order is selected. It will display the number of purchase orders selected and the actions which can be taken. Click `Delete`.

A notification confirms how many purchase orders were deleted (bottom left corner).

<div class="note">
You can only delete Purchase Orders with a status <code>New</code>.
</div>

## Outstanding Purchase Order Lines

To see the lines currently outstanding on purchase orders, tap on the `Outstanding lines` button.

This will take you to a list of lines currently outstanding. These are lines that have been sent to the supplier, but are yet to be received or are partially received.

    <figcaption align="center">Status Sequence: current status is <code>Sent</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

There are 5 statuses for the Purchase Orders (although you might see a smaller number, if Authorisation is not required):

| Status                 | Description                                                                                                                   | mSupply | Lines editable | Lines editable for authorised users |
| :--------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----: | :------------: | :---------------------------------: |
| **New**                | This is the first status when you create a new Purchase Order                                                                 |   nw    |       ✓        |                  ✓                  |
| **Ready for Approval** | The order is ready to be approved by someone with authorisation (applies only if the Requires Authorisation preference is on) |   sg    |       ✓        |                  ✓                  |
| **Ready for Sending**  | The purchase order is ready to send to the supplier                                                                           |   cn    |                |                  ✓                  |
| **Sent**               | The purchase order has been sent to the supplier. Purchase order lines will be updated to the `Sent` status                   |   cn    |                |                  ✓                  |
| **Finalised**          | When you confirm that the order has been received. Purchase order lines will be updated to the `Closed` status                |   fn    |                |                                     |

The Ready for Approval status only applies if the Authorise Purchase Orders global preference is turned on. If the preference is off, purchase orders will progress from New status to Ready for Sending.

You'll see that the status bar has only the status values which apply depending on Authorisation preferences.

    <figcaption align="center">Status Sequence: current status is <code>Ready for sending</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you hover over the status sequence, an order history window appears. You can see the date when a purchase order was updated from one status to another.

<div class="imagetitle">
This purchase order has been created on 24/09/2025, ready for sending on 24/09/2025 and sent on 30/09/2025
</div>

### Confirm button

The `Confirm` button is the button to update the status of a purchase order. The status which you can confirm depends on the current status of the purchase order and follows the sequence shown below.

When managing a Purchase Order, you can only confirm the next status which is shown on the button. Statuses cannot be skipped.

| Confirm...             | Current Status     | Next Status (If Authorisation is on) | Next Status (If Authorisation is off) |

Purchase orders must proceed through the statuses in the exact order. The status can also go back to a previous step when certain actions are taken. The system will always show you the next available status on the button.

Clicking on the confirm button will show a prompt to proceed, which may have further information.

<div class="note">
If the purchase order is at <code>Sent</code> status and the <code>Adjusted packs</code> are edited for an item, the purchase order status will change to 
<code>Ready for sending</code> and the line status will change to <code>New</code></div>

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, we are ordering 50 packs of 100 for item <i>030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs</i> with a price of $35 per pack and an item discount of 5%. 
</div>

![Add Item quantities](images/po_additem_quantities.png)

<div class="note">The 'Ordered in other purchase orders' is a count of how many units of the same item are in other purchase orders with status 'Sent'</div>

### Confirm item and quantities

When you're done, you can add the new line by tapping on:

- `OK` if you don't want to add another line to your purchase order
- `OK & Next` if you have other lines to create

Otherwise, you can tap on `Cancel` and your changes won't be saved.

## Adding lines to a Purchase Order using a Master List

Tap on the `Add from master list` button from the Add button selection.

<div class="note">
The button will be disabled if the status of the Purchase Order is anything other than <strong>New</strong> or <strong>Ready for Approval</strong>
</div>

![Add Item button](images/po_add_button_masterlist.png)

A new `Master Lists` window opens. This allows you to select the required master list. Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).

![Add Item button](../../images/add-item-master-lists.png)

Click `OK` on the prompt:
![Add Item button](../../images/add-item-master-list-prompt.png)

You will then have placeholder lines added to your purchase order, which will then look like this:

![Add Item button](images/po_placeholder_lines.png)

The imported rows will have zero for the number of packs value, and are therefore shown in a blue font with no requested amount or pricing. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.

## Adding lines to a Purchase Order using an Import

Tap on the `Import lines` button from the Add button selection.

<div class="note">
The button will be disabled if the status of the Purchase Order is anything other than <strong>New</strong> or <strong>Ready for Approval</strong>
</div>

![Add Item button](images/po_add_button_import.png)

This will open an import modal. Click on `Download a template` to download a csv
template which can be used to import assets.

Data will need to be converted into the format of the csv template provided in order for Open mSupply to be able to process and upload this data.

When you are ready, drag and drop the csv file into the modal or click on the `Browse files` button to select the file from your computer.

![](images/po_download_template.png)

##### Upload Errors

After uploading your CSV file, your data will be validated and displayed to you to review. At this step, if the data in your uploaded file is not valid, you will see an error message and won't be able to continue to the import step.

![](images/po_upload_file.png)

Common mistakes here are uploading a file type other than CSV, or if a price value or calculation results in an invalid number. You'll see these errors in the `Error message` column.

You can use the `Export` button at the bottom of the upload window to download a CSV file which includes the error messages, to investigate what went wrong.

Once you have corrected the errors, you can go back to the `Upload` tab to upload the corrected file.
