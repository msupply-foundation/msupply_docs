## Setup

To use R&R Forms, ensure that you enable the store preference for `Open mSupply: Uses program module`.

![Store preference](/docs/programs/images/program_pref.png)

You'll also need a program configured and visible in your store, and the program will need a period schedule associated with it.

Start with configuring [periods and schedules](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/admin:schedules_periods), then create a program and associate the schedule.

See the [mSupply docs](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/items:programs) for configuring programs - note though that you'll only need the start of this process, which is to create a program and associate a schedule. For R&R forms, the other program configuration aspects aren't used yet.

## R&R Forms - List View

Go to `Replenishment` > `R&R Forms` to view the list of R&R Forms.

![R&R Navigation](/docs/replenishment/images/goto_rnr.png)

You can click the column headers to sort the list by that column.

![R&R List](/docs/replenishment/images/rnr_list.png)

Clicking on an R&R form will take you to the details page.

### Add an R&R Form

To add an R&R Form, click the `Add Form` button on the top right corner of the screen.

![Add Button](/docs/replenishment/images/rnr_add_button.png)

A window will open for you to select the program, schedule, period and supplier for the R&R form.

![Add R&R: empty](/docs/replenishment/images/add_rnr_empty.png)

The first time you create an R&R form, you will need to select each of these options. After that, the inputs will be pre-filled with the previous period's data.

<div class="imagetitle">Our most recent R&R form was from April 2024, for Program Tb. The same program, schedule and supplier are selected, and the next period is chosen automatically.</div>

![Add R&R: pre-filled](/docs/replenishment/images/add_rnr.png)

The first time you create an R&R form, you can select any available period. After that, you will only be able to select the next period in the sequence.

<div class="imagetitle">The previous R&R form was for the APR 24 period</div>

![Add R&R: pre-selected period](/docs/replenishment/images/add_rnr_selected_period.png)

Note that you cannot create the next R&R form until the previous one is finalised:

![Warning: need to finalise previous](/docs/replenishment/images/add_rnr_error_finalise.png)

Once you are happy with your inputs, click `OK` to generate the form. You will be redirected to the R&R form details page.

## Detail View
