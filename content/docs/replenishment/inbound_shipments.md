Inbound Shipments can be used to receive stock from suppliers.

If you have used mSupply in the past, you may be familiar with the term **Supplier Invoice** instead of Inbound Shipment.

All received goods should be recorded in mSupply either by:

- Manually creating an Inbound Shipment (manual Inbound Shipment)
- Working with an Inbound Shipment that has been created automatically as a result of a stock transfer from another store in your mSupply

## Viewing Inbound Shipments

### Go to the Inbound Shipments Menu

![Go to Inbound Shipments](/docs/replenishment/images/is_gotois.png)

To access the **Inbound Shipment** menu:

1. Go to the `Replenishment` menu in the navigation panel
2. Click on `Inbound Shipment`

### Inbound Shipments list

First thing you see is a list of existing Inbound Shipments.

The Inbound Shipments list is divided into 7 columns:

| Column        | Description                                                                   |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**      | Name of the Supplier                                                          |
| **Status**    | Current Status of the shipment                                                |
| **Number**    | Reference Number of the shipment                                              |
| **Created**   | Creation date of the shipment                                                 |
| **Delivered** | Date when the shipment was delivered                                          |
| **Comment**   | Comment for the shipment                                                      |
| **Reference** | This will contain the supplier invoice number if it was created automatically |
| **Total**     | Total value of the shipment                                                   |

2. The list can display a fixed number of shipments per page. On the bottom left corner, you can see how many shipments are currently displayed on your screen.

![Page](/docs/distribution/images/os_list_showing.png)

3. If you have more shipments than the current limit, you can navigate to the other pages by clicking on the page number or using the right of left arrows (bottom right corner).

![Page](/docs/distribution/images/os_list_pagenumbers.png)

4. You can also select a different number of rows to show per page using the option at the bottom right of the page.

![Rows per page](/docs/introduction/images/rows-per-page-select.png)

### Filter Inbound Shipments

You can filter the list of shipments by supplier name, created date or status. This can be useful if you're looking for one particular shipment!

![Inbound Shipments filter](/docs/replenishment/images/is_filter.png)

For example, to filter by supplier name, click on `Filters`, select `Name` and start typing some or all of a supplier name in the `Name` field. All the shipments for this supplier will appear in the list.

![Inbound shipment name filter](/docs/replenishment/images/is_name_filter.gif)

### Exporting Inbound Shipments

The list of Inbound Shipments can be exported to a comma separated file (csv). Simply click the export button (on the right, at the top of the page)

![Export button](/docs/distribution/images/export.png)

and the file will be downloaded. The export function will download all Inbound Shipments, not just the current page, if you have more than 20 of them.

### Delete an Inbound Shipment

You can delete a shipment from the Inbound Shipment list.

1. Select the shipment that you want to delete by checking the box on the left end of the list. You can select more than one shipments to be deleted. You can even select them all using the master checkbox in the list headers.

2. The `Actions` footer will display at the bottom of the screen when a shipment is selected. It will display the number of shipments selected and the actions which can be taken. Click `Delete`.

A notification confirms how many shipments were deleted (bottom left corner).

<div class="note">
You can only delete Inbound Shipments with a status <code>NEW</code>.
</div>

## Creating a new manual Inbound Shipment

1. Go to `Replenishment`> `Inbound Shipment`
2. Press the `New Shipment` button, in the top right corner
3. A new window `Suppliers` opens, inviting you to select a supplier

### Select a Supplier

1. In the `Suppliers` window, you will be presented with a list of suppliers. You can select your supplier from the list or you can type as much of a supplier name as you want.

<div class="tip">

</div>

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, we are receiving stock from <b>Tamaki Central Medical Store</b>. 
</div>

![Select a Supplier](/docs/replenishment/images/is_selectsupplier.gif)

2. Once you have selected a supplier, your Inbound Shipment is created.

<div class="imagetitle">
If everything went well, you should see the name of your supplier in the top left corner and current status should be <code>New</code>.
</div>

![New manual Inbound Shipment](/docs/replenishment/images/is_newinboundshipment.png)

### Edit the Supplier Name

If you have selected the wrong supplier, you can change the supplier name in the `Supplier Name` field or select one the dropdown list:

<div class="imagetitle">

The pen icon will become active once the above instructions have been followed and only if the customer is an external customer. Click on this icon and change to a currency that you would like to issue the shipment in. The currency rate can also be edited if you and the customer have agreed on a different rate.
![gif](/docs/replenishment/images/is-change-foreign-currency.gif)
You can also see the foreign currency totals in the invoice line details as well.
![Line with Foreign Currency Pricing](/docs/replenishment/images/is-line-with-foreign-currency.png)

### Inbound Shipment Status Sequence

The status sequence is located at the bottom left corner of the Inbound Shipment screen.

Passed statuses are hightlighted in blue, next statuses appear in grey.

<figure>
    <img src="/docs/replenishment/images/is_statussequence2.png" alt="Inbound Shipment Status Sequence (New)" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption align="center">Status Sequence: current status is <code>New</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="/docs/replenishment/images/is_statussequence3.png" alt="Inbound Shipment Status Sequence (Shipped)" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption align="center">Status Sequence: current status is </i><code>Shipped</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

There are 5 status for the Inbound Shipment:

| Status        | Description                                                                                                        |
| :------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New**       | This is the first status when you create a new manual Inbound Shipment                                             |
| **Picked**    | Supplier has confirmed that shipment is picked and ready to ship (applies only to automatically created shipments) |
| **Shipped**   | Shipment has been shipped and goods are now in transit (applies only to automatically created shipments)           |
| **Delivered** | When you confirm that the shipment has been delivered                                                              |
| **Verified**  | When you have verified the Inbound Shipment                                                                        |

You probably noticed that two of the status values only apply to automatically created shipments. These are created by the system when another store in the system creates an Outbound Shipment to deliver stock to your store. If this is the case you'll see a message near the top of the page:

![Automatic IS message](/docs/replenishment/images/is_message_automatic.png)

Note that this message appears differently if the status is `Delivered` or `Verified`

![Automatic IS message: delivered](/docs/replenishment/images/is_message_automatic_delivered.png)

If, however, you've created an Inbound Shipment manually, then the following message shows:

![Manual IS message](/docs/replenishment/images/is_message_manual.png)

and you'll see that the status bar has only the status values which apply to this type of shipment.

<figure align="center">
    <img src="/docs/replenishment/images/is_statussequence4.png" alt="Inbound Shipment Status Sequence (New & manual)" style="width:60%">
    <figcaption align="center">Status Sequence: current status is </i><code>New</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you hover over the status sequence, a shipment history window appears. You can see the date when a shipment was updated from one status to another.

<div class="imagetitle">
This manual shipment has been created on 03/03/2022
</div>

![Inbound status: hover 2](/docs/replenishment/images/is_statussequence_hover2.png)

<div class="imagetitle">
This automatic shipment has been created on 03/03/2022, allocated on 04/03/2022 and picked on 07/03/2022
</div>

![Inbound status: hover](/docs/replenishment/images/is_statussequence_hover.png)

### Hold checkbox

Located on the bottom left corner, on the left of the status sequence.

Check the `Hold` checkbox prevents the Inbound Shipment from being updated to the next status.

![Inbound hold checkbox](/docs/distribution/images/os_holdcheckbox.png)

### Close and Confirm button

#### Close Button

Click on the `Close` button to quit the Inbound Shipment view and return to the Inbound Shipments list.

#### Confirm Button

The `Confirm` button is the button to update the status of a shipment. The status which you can confirm depends on the current status of the shipment and follows the sequence shown below.

When managing an Inbound Shipment, you can only confirm it as Delivered or Verified.

| Confirm...            | Current Status | Next Status |
| :-------------------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| **Confirm Delivered** | Shipped        | Delivered   |
| **Confirm Verified**  | Delivered      | Verified    |

You don't have to update a shipment to next status in the sequence. You can choose to skip some of them to go directly to `Confirm Verified` for example.

As demonstrated below, tap on the down arrow of the `Confirm` button and select the status you want the shipment to be updated to.

![Skip Status](/docs/replenishment/images/is_skipstatus.gif)

## Adding lines to an Inbound Shipment

To add a line, tap on the `Add Item` button located in the top left corner of your screen.

A new `Add Item` window opens.

![Inbound: add item button](/docs/replenishment/images/is_additem_button.png)

### Select an Item

In the `Add Item` window, you can look up an item by:

- Reading through the list of available items
- or by typing some or all of an item name

1. **Batch**: Type here the batch number. Leave blank if item is not managed with batch number.
2. **Expiry**: The expiry date of the batch number. Leave blank is not applicable
3. **Pack Qty**: The quantity of packs you are receiving
4. **Pack Size**: The quantity of units per pack (by default, pack size is 1)
5. **Unit Qty** (read-only): Automatically calculated based on # Packs and Pack Size (`[# Packs] x [Pack Size]`)
6. If you are receiving more than one batch number for the same item, you can tap on the `Add Batch` button

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, we are receiving 2 batch numbers for item <i>030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs</i> with a different pack size. 
</div>

![Add Item quantities](/docs/replenishment/images/is_additem_quantities.png)

### Pricing tab

On the second tab, `Pricing`, you can update the following fields (all are optional):

- **Batch** (read-only): Batch number
- **Pack Size** (read-only): The quantity of units per pack
- **Pack Qty** (read-only): The quantity of packs you are receiving
- **Cost**: The purchasing unit price of the item (default value is 0)

- **Line Total** (read-only): Total purchasing value for the batch number (`[Pack Qty] x [Cost]`)

<div class="warning">
Sell & Cost prices are per units and not per pack. 
</div>

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, the first line's cost price is $0.01 per unit and the sell price $0.10 per unit. 
</div>

![Add Item pricing](/docs/replenishment/images/is_additem_pricing.png)

### Location tab

In the third tab, `Location`, you can select a storage location to assign the batch number to a location in your storage facility.

Simply select a storage location from the `Location` dropdown menu.

![Add Item location](/docs/replenishment/images/is_additem_location.png)

<div class="note">
Don't know the storage location yet? You don't have to capture it right away. You can update the storage location at any time if you haven't confirmed the verification yet. 
</div>

### Confirm item and quantities

When you're done, you can add the new line by tapping on:

- `OK` if you don't want to add another line to your shipment
- `OK & Next` if you have other lines to create

Otherwise, you can tap on `Cancel` and your changes won't be saved.

## Adding lines to an Inbound Shipment using a Master List

Tap on the `Add from master list` button (top right corner).

<div class="note">
The button will be disabled if the status of the Inbound Shipment is anything other than <code>New</code>
</div>

![Add Item button](/docs/distribution/images/os-add-from-master-list-button.png)

A new `Master Lists` window opens. This allows you to select the required master list. Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).

![Add Item button](/docs/distribution/images/os-add-item-master-lists.png)

Click `OK` on the prompt:
![Add Item button](/docs/distribution/images/os-add-item-master-list-prompt.png)

You will then have placeholder lines added to your shipment, which will then look like this:

![Add Item button](/docs/replenishment/images/is-after-master-list.png)

The imported rows will have zero for the number of packs value, and are therefore shown in a blue font with the batch, expiry, location etc not shown. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.

## Editing an Inbound Shipment line

To edit an Inbound Shipment line, simply tap on it. You will be presented with the `Edit Item` window, which is identical to the `Add Item` window, except that the item is already chosen and cannot be modified.

### Edit a Shipment Line

<div class="note">
 <b></b> you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status higher lower than <code>Verified</code>. 
</div>

1. Open the Inbound Shipment you want to edit
2. Tap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to `Add Item` appears. At this stage:

   - Edit the main `Issue Quantity` field
   - or change the number of packs value at the batch number level

<div class="note">
 <b></b> When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. 
</div>

### Delete a Shipment line

1. Open the Inbound Shipment that you would like to edit
2. Make sure that status is not yet `VERIFIED`
3. Select the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the left of the list
4. Click the `Delete` button which appears at the bottom of the page.

![Alt Text](/docs/replenishment/images/delete-inbound-shipment-line.gif)

<div class="tip">
You can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. 
</div>

## Receiving stock with an Inbound Shipment

### Confirm the delivery of the shipment

Whether your Inbound Shipment is **manual** or **automatic**, the first step to receive the goods is to confirm the delivery.

At this stage, you don't have to check if quantities or other information are correct, you just have to acknowledge that you have received the goods from your supplier.

To confirm that an Inbound Shipment has been delivered, click on the `Confirm Delivered` button.

Once you have done this:

- Goods are now part of your inventory
- Shipment status is now `DELIVERED`

<div class="note">
In case your Inbound Shipment is <b>automatic</b>, you cannot confirm its delivery unless the supplier has confirmed its shipment. In other words, your shipment status has to be <code>SHIPPED</code> before you can confirm that you have received the goods. 
</div>

<div class="note">
Any unallocated lines with a 0 number of packs value will automatically be removed for you when you confirm.
</div>

### Verify your Inbound Shipment

Verification is the last step to receive goods in mSupply. At this stage, you can check what you have received and make sure that that information in mSupply are correct.

You have the possibility to verify the following information:

- Batch numbers and their expiry dates
- Quantity of packs and pack size
- Pricing information: cost and sell prices

You can also capture where received goods are to be stored in the `Location` tab.

Once all information have been captured or verified, you can confirm the Shipment as `VERIFIED` by tapping on the `Confirm Verified` button.

Once you have done this:

- Shipment status is now `VERIFIED`
- You can no longer edit shipment lines
- You can no longer delete the shipment

## Returning stock from an Inbound Shipment

Sometimes, you might need to return stock that you received via an Inbound Shipment. You can do this by creating an [Supplier Return](../outbound-returns).

1. Open the Inbound Shipment for which you would like to return some or all of the stock
2. Make sure that status is at least `DELIVERED`
3. Select the line(s) you want to return by checking the box(es) on the left of the list
4. Click the `Return selected lines` button which appears at the bottom of the page.

![Process return inbound shipment line](/docs/replenishment/images/return-inbound-shipment-line.png)

#### Select quantity to return

A modal will open, containing each line you selected to return:

|              Column               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             **Code**              | Item code                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|             **Name**              | Item name                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|             **Batch**             | Batch number. It is a designation given to products made in the same manufacturing run.                                                                                                          |
|            **Expiry**             | Expiry date of the batch (format: MM/YYYY)                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Quantity Available for Return** | Number of packs available. This means the number of packs not already allocated to other shipments or returns, so the quantity could be less than the quantity received in the Inbound Shipment. |
|      **Quantity to Return**       | Number of packs to be returned                                                                                                                                                                   |

![Alt Text](/docs/replenishment/images/is_return_select_quantity.png)

The `Quantity to Return` values will initially be `0` - you can adjust this to return some or all of the available stock.

#### Warnings

If you forget to enter a quantity to return for any batch and click `Next step`, you will see this warning message. You'll need to add a quantity to return from at least one batch. You can click `Cancel` if you no longer want to return any of this stock.
![Alt Text](/docs/replenishment/images/is_selectquantity_warning.png)

#### Provide reasons

Once you are happy with your quantities to return, you can click `Next step`. The list of batches will be filtered to only include the batches you provided a return quantity for. In this view, you can provide a reason for returning each batch, and an additional comment.

![Alt Text](/docs/replenishment/images/is_return_lines.gif)

#### Confirm

When you are happy with the quantities and reasons, you can press on:

- the `OK` button. A Supplier Return will be created, and you will be redirected to view it. The quantities of stock selected to return will be reserved for the new return.

## Viewing an Inbound Shipment

When viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.
To change the view mode, click the `Group by item` switch.

When grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:

If you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.

Click on the `Show / hide columns` button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see. The options chosen are stored for the current browser, so next time you view an inbound shipment, you will see the selected columns only. If you have chosen which columns to show, then the button is shown in blue to remind you that there are more columns available.
