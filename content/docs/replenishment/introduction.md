### Terminology Updates

We've changed the names in Open mSupply to align with industry best practice - we agree that this can take a bit of getting used to!

### Overall workflow

{%mermaid ()%}

flowchart LR
    subgraph s1["Ordering Store"]
        n1(Create Internal Order) --- n2(Finalise Order)
        n3(Receive Shipment as **Inbound Shipment**)
    end
    subgraph s2["Supplying Store"]
        n2 --- d1(Receive as **Requisition**)
        d1 --- d2
        d2(Process Requisition)
        d2 --- d3(Create and Send Outbound Shipment)
        d3 --- n3
    end
    style s1 fill:#FFBD59
{%end%}


### A more complex workflow including authorisation:

  A[Customer Requisition Received] --> B[Review Requisition using Authorization module]
  B -->|Approved| C[Generate Shipment]
  B -->|Rejected| X[Notify Customer & End Process]
  C --> D[Print pick list]
  D --> E[Pick Goods]
  E -->|Checked & Correct| F[Arrange Transport]
  E -->|Errors in 
   Pick list 
   vs 
   Physical Stock?| Y[Resolve Issues & Retry]
  Y -->E
  F --> G[Mark shipment with status _Shipped_]

  G --> H[Inspect Shipment]
  H -->|Accepted| I[Update Inventory & Notify Customer]
  H -->|Rejected| Z[Report Issue & Return to Supplier]
  I --> J[Process Inbound Shipment Completion]

  end
