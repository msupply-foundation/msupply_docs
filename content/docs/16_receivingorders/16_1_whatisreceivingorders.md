### Receiving Goods and Inbound Shipments

**Receiving Goods** is the next step in the **Replenishment** process, occurring after an order has been placed. It ensures that the stock you ordered arrives at your store or facility and is accurately logged into your inventory.

In Open mSupply, goods that are being received are referred to as **Inbound Shipments**. During this process, items are checked against the order to confirm that the correct products, quantities, and specifications have been delivered. Once the inbound shipment is confirmed, inventory levels are updated to reflect the newly received stock.

Receiving goods in a timely and accurate manner ensures that replenishment is effective and inventory records remain up-to-date. Properly receiving goods also helps prevent issues like stockouts or excess inventory by ensuring that the right products are added to your system as soon as they arrive.

For more details on how this process fits into the broader supply chain, refer to the [Supply Chain Overview](/docs/11_terminologyprocess/11-2-supplychainoverview/).
