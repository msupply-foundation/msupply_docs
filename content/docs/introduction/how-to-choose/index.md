## How to choose the Right Combination of Products for Your Country

Selecting the right combination of products to meet your country’s healthcare and supply chain needs is crucial. It involves considering key factors to ensure the tools you choose work well together, are scalable, and address your country’s specific challenges. Here’s a simple guide to help you make the best choice:

#### 1. **Assess Your Country's Healthcare Infrastructure**
   - ***Review your current systems:*** Start by reviewing your healthcare and supply chain systems. Consider factors like infrastructure, technology adoption, workflows, and resources.
   - ***Identify gaps and challenges:*** Look for areas where your systems may be lacking—such as in stock management, reporting, or procurement—that are preventing efficient operations.

#### 2. **Define Your Goals and Objectives**
   - ***Clarify your objectives:*** Determine what you want to achieve with the product combination. This could include improving stock visibility, automating compliance, streamlining procurement, or enhancing data analytics.
   - ***Prioritize needs:*** Identify the most urgent needs, like better vaccine tracking, ensuring essential medicines are available, or improving overall supply chain efficiency.

#### 3. **Evaluate Available Products**
   - ***Understand the product features:*** Familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the products in your selected suite. For example, Open mSupply is great for inventory management, and Conforma can help with regulatory approvals. Consider how these products address your specific challenges, such as cold chain management or procurement processes.

#### 4. **Identify What's Missing and Discuss Customizations**
   - ***Assess gaps with our support:*** We’ll work with you to evaluate your systems and workflows to identify areas for improvement. This could include missing functionality, integration issues, or customization needs to better fit local requirements.
