Internal Orders go by several other names in certain countries or systems:

- Requisitions
- Orders
- Report & Requisition
- R&R

Internal Orders are a way to support users in requesting new stock from another store.

## Viewing Internal Orders

If you would like to order some stock from your supplier:

1. Navigate to the `Replenishment` menu
2. Tap on `Internal Orders`

![Internal Order: nav](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_access.png)

You will see a list of all existing Internal Orders:

![Internal Order: list](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_list.png)

You can use the filters to filter the list by the name or status of the Internal Orders:

![Internal Order: filter](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_filter.png)

You can sort the list using the column headers:

1. Tap the column header of the column that you want to sort. The column is sorted in ascending order.
2. Tap the column header again and column will be sorted in the opposite order.

## Creating a new Internal Order

### Select a supplier

1. Click on the `New Order` button (top right corner):

![Internal Order: new order](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_newreqbutton.png)

2. A new window opens, inviting your to select a supplier:

![Internal Order: select supplier](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_selectsupplier2.png)

3. Select a Supplier by pressing on their name. You will be redirected to a window like this:

![Internal Order: newly created order](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_newintord.png)

### Defining Target MOS (Maximum MOS)

Additional information and configuration for the Internal Order can be found in the detail panel, which you can access by clicking the `More` button in the top right:

![MaxMOS](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_moreinfo.png)

Defining the Target MOS (Month of Stock) is critical to the calculation of the **Suggested Quantity**:

- There is an industry rule of thumb that the _Target MOS_ should be set to 3 times the ordering cycle
- The default _Target MOS_ is `3.0`, which is based on a monthly ordering cycle
- If for example, the ordering cycle was every two months, then _Target MOS_ should be set to 3 x 2 = `6.0`

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, we are setting our Target MOS to 3 Months.  
</div>

![MaxMOS](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_maxmos.png)

This can be done before or after adding items to your order.

### Adding a single item

Tap on `Add Item` to add a single item to your order. You will be redirected to
a new page.

![Internal Order: add item](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_additem2.png)

First select the item you want to add to your order. You can also type some or all of an item name (or code) to look for a specific item.

Once item is selected, you should see the following information on the page:

- **Item Name**
- **SOH**: Stock on Hand. How much stock the store currently has available
- **AMC**: Average Monthly Consumption. How much stock your store uses each month on average (based on a configurable number of months, default is set to 3 months)
- **Units/Packs toggle**: this allows you to switch between ordering in units or packs
- **Default pack size**: the default pack size of the item
- **Requested quantity**: the quantity of units that you request from your supplier
- **Default pack size**: the default pack size of the item
- **Suggested Quantity**: how much stock mSupply suggests that your order to reach your stock target quantity
- **Comments**: any comments you want to add to the order

You should also see the following charts if you click the bar graph icon next to
requested quantity:

![](/docs/replenishment/images/io_bar_graph_icon.png)

- **Target Quantity**: In this chart, you will see the following information:
  - The _Target Quantity_ for the item. This is calculated as: Target MOS x AMC.
  - Your current _Stock on Hand_ (in grey)
  - The _Suggested Order Quantity_ calculated by mSupply

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, our target quantity is 609 units which is the equivalent of 3 months of stock (3 x 203 = 609 units). Our stock on hand (in grey) is 269 so in order to reach my target, mSupply suggests to order 342 units (609 - 269). 
</div>

![Stock Distribution](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_charts_stockdistri.png)

<div class="imagetitle">
In the below example, the target quantity is 408 units. Since we already have 467 units in stock (in grey), the suggested quantity is zero. 
</div>

![Stock Distribution 2](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_charts_stockdistri2.png)

- **Consumption History (monthly)**: this chart shows the monthly consumption up to 12 months in the past (in grey), the current AMC (in dark grey), the projected consumption (in orange) and the moving average (blue line):

![Consumption](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_charts_consumption.png)

- **Stock Evolution**: this chart shows you your stock level for the last 30 days and your projected inventory for the next 30 days. The projected stock will be updated based on your inputs in the `Requested quantity` field:

![Stock Evolution](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_charts_stockevolution.png)

### Requesting a quantity in packs

If the item which you have selected has a default pack size configured (see the mSupply documentation on [editing units](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/items:adding_a_new_item#general_tab) for details on how to do this) then you will see a few additional elements on the 'Add item' window:

### Adding items using a master list

If your organisation is using Master Lists, you can add multiple items at once using your store's master lists. It is particularly useful when you have a lot of items in your order and you don't want to add them all one by one.

1. Tap on the `Add from master list` button
2. Select a master list
3. A dialog window opens asking you whether you want to add all of the items from this master list. Tap `OK` if you wish to proceed.

All the items of the master list are now listed in your order. If you had previously added single item, it will add items that are not already there.

Tap on an order line to change the **Requested Quantity** or tap on the `Use
Suggested Quantities` button to automatically copy the values in the **Suggested Quantity** column into the **Requested Quantity** column.

![Internal Order: add from master list](/docs/replenishment/images/intord_addfromml.gif)

<div class="note"> 
Master Lists are defined and assigned to stores at the central server level. You can only see the master lists that are visible to your store. 
<br>Also be aware that if you are using programs functionality, only master lists which are not part of a program can be selected.
<br> <br>
If you don't find the master list you are looking for and if you want to create a new one, please contact your administrator.
</div>

<div class="tip">
You can create Internal Orders from multiple master lists by repeating above actions with another master list. 
</div>

### Reading the Internal Order's list

When you add items (using a master list or not), the item is added to the order's table. The following information is provided for each order line:

| Column                   | Description                                                                                                                                        |

| **DPS**                  | Default pack size of the item                                                                                                                      |

| **AMC**                  | Average Monthly Consumption: how much stock your store uses each month on average (based on a configurable number of months, defaults to 3 months) |
| **Target Stock**         | This is the stock you are aiming for. Calculated as: AMC x Target MOS MOS                                                                          |
| **Suggested Quantity**   | How much stock mSupply suggests that your order. This is calculated as: (AMC x Target MOS) - SoH                                                   |
| **Requested**            | This is set to zero by default. This is the quantity of units you are ordering from your supplier.                                                 |
