### What is Replenishment?
**Replenishment** is the process of restocking inventory to maintain optimal stock levels in your store or facility. It ensures that you have enough products on hand to meet customer demand and avoid stockouts. 

Replenishment involves ordering products from suppliers or internal stores to replace items that are running low.

### Purchasing & Ordering Goods

**Purchasing and Ordering Goods** is the process of acquiring stock and supplies needed for your store or facility, which helps in the process of **Replenishment**.

It involves creating orders to request products from suppliers, ensuring that inventory levels are maintained and that products are available to meet the needs of customers. 

This process includes activities such as placing internal orders, filling out request forms, and generating purchase orders to replenish stock. Efficient ordering and purchasing help prevent stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and keep operations running smoothly.

For more details on how this process fits into the broader supply chain, refer to the [Supply Chain Overview](/docs/11_terminologyprocess/11-2-supplychainoverview/).
