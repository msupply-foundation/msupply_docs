## What is the HIV Program Module?

The **HIV Program Module** is specifically designed to support the management and tracking of HIV-related patient care, including medication, treatment regimens, and clinical follow-ups. This module allows healthcare providers to efficiently monitor patient progress, ensure adherence to prescribed treatments, and track any complications or co-infections.

## Set Up
