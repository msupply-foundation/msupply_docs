## What is the Family Planning Program?

The Family Planning Program is designed to help manage and track family planning services provided to patients. This includes recording contraceptive prescriptions, monitoring patient adherence, and ensuring the availability of necessary supplies. The program helps healthcare providers coordinate care, offer personalized advice, and track family planning progress.

## Set up

See [Patient Programs](/docs/22_programs/22-1-whatisprograms/) for setting up the Family Planning Program Module. Note: This module is currently only availabe in French.

### Recording Contraceptive Dispensings

Recording contraceptive dispensings is an essential part of managing the **Family Planning Program**. This process ensures that patients receive the correct contraceptive methods as prescribed, and updates inventory records accordingly. 

#### Steps to Record Contraceptive Dispensings:
   
1. **Select Chosen Method**: Once the contraceptive method is selected, confirm the specific method the patient will be using.

3. **Create Prescription**: Create a prescription for the patient by specifying the product for the chosen method.

4. **Select Specific Batch and Quantity**: Select the specific batch of contraceptive items to issue. Open mSupply allows you to choose the appropriate batch based on stock availability.

5. **Issue the Contraceptive**: Once the batch and quantity are selected, issue the contraceptive items to the patient. This action generates a dispensing record under **Prescriptions** and updates the inventory by removing the issued items from stock.
