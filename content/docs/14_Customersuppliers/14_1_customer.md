## What is a Customer?

A **Customer** is any entity or organization that your store distributes goods to. Customers are the recipients of the items your store supplies, such as health centers, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, or other healthcare facilities. 

Understanding your customers' needs is crucial for ensuring that their orders are fulfilled accurately and on time. Customers rely on your store to provide them with the stock they require for their operations.
