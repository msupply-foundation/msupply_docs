## What is a Supplier?
A **Supplier** is an external or internal entity that replenishes your store with stock. 

Suppliers can include manufacturers, wholesalers, or central warehouses that provide the products your store needs to maintain inventory levels. 

Suppliers play a critical role in ensuring your store is adequately stocked with the right items, allowing you to fulfill orders to your customers and maintain smooth operations in the supply chain.
