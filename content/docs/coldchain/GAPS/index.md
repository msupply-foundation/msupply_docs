### Gap analysis planning system (GAPS)

The gap analysis planning system (GAPS) is a tool designed to help EPI teams to assess whether their CCE infrastructure is sufficient to meet expected demand.

The GAPS module allows EPI teams to: 
- Capture current CCE volume capacity for the country
- Forecast the expected demand for CCE volume capacity over the next 5 years
- Compare the current CCE volume capacity to the expected demand
- Identify facilities that will need intervention due to increased demand
- Identify facilities that will need intervention due to CCE reaching end-of-life

### Capturing current CCE volume capacity

The current CCE volume capacity for the country can be captured by:
1. Registering all CCE for all facilities in the [CCEI module](/docs/coldchain/equipment/). 
2. Implementing a robust SOP for facilities to report the functional status of their CCE
#### 1. Registering CCE

#### 2. Reporting CCE functional status
### Forecasting expected demand for CCE volume capacity

### Comparing current CCE volume capacity to expected demand

### Identifying facilities that need intervention
