Cold Chain Equipment is a digital register for the creation and management of cold chain assets. It allows health departments to manage, record functional status logs, and update locations of cold chain assets.

From the **Equipment** menu, all assets available in a store can be viewed.

<!--
TODO: Add link to central server docs when they are created
-->

Cold chain assets from all stores are visible when accessing the **Equipment** menu via Open mSupply central server.

Here you can see all cold chain equipment available in your store.

The equipment list is divided into 6 columns:

#### Paginate Equipment

The list can display a fixed number of assets per page. On the bottom left corner, you can see how many assets are currently displayed on your screen.

![Page](/docs/distribution/images/os_list_showing.png)

If you have more assets than the current limit, you can navigate to the other pages by tapping on the page number or using the right of left arrows (bottom right corner).

![Page](/docs/distribution/images/os_list_pagenumbers.png)

You can also select a different number of rows to show per page using the option at the bottom right of the page.

![Rows per page](/docs/introduction/images/rows-per-page-select.png)

#### Filter Equipment

To add a filter to the page, choose the required filter from the drop down. Multiple filters can be combined.

![Equipment filters](/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_filter.png)

#### Delete Equipment

Assets can be selected and deleted using the toolbar action:

![](/docs/coldchain/images/delete_rows.png)

### Importing And Exporting

#### Import

Cold chain assets can be imported from a comma-separated-value (csv) file using the `Import` button

![](/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_import_button.png)

This will open an import modal. Click on `Download a template` to download a csv
template which can be used to import assets.

![](/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_import_modal.png)

When importing assets from a store, they will be assigned to that store.

<!--
TODO: Add link to central server docs when they are created
-->

When importing assets on the central server, an additional field of `store` will be required which will assign assets to their respective stores.

Information will need to be entered in the format provided by the csv template in order for Open mSupply to be able to process and upload this data.

| Column                  | Description                                                      | Example            | Mandatory         |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| **Asset Number**        | The asset number assigned by the user's organisation             | 1                  | \*                |
| **Catalogue item code** | The Asset Catalogue code - i.e. the kind of asset to be imported | E003/002           | \*                |
| **Store**               | The code of the Store to which the asset is to be assigned       | CMS                | \* (central only) |
| **Notes**               | General notes about the asset                                    | Kept in EPI office |                   |
| **Serial Number**       | The serial number of that particular asset                       | 123456789ABC       |                   |
| **Installation date**   | The date that the asset was installed at the Store               | 2024-01-14         |                   |

A csv file can be uploaded once it has been created in the example format.

### QR code scanning

If you are running Open mSupply on a tablet, or are running the desktop version, you will get an extra button on the menu bar which allows scanning QR codes. This is the `Scan` button:

![Scan button](/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_scan.png)

You may see this notification when you click the button:

![Scan button](/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_scan_error.png)

If you do, don't panic! Head over to the [Barcode Scanners](/docs/settings/devices/#barcode-scanners) section of the `Settings` documentation and configure a scanner before continuing.

Once you have a scanner connected - you can click the `Scan` button and scan a QR code.
If a match is found when you scan, you'll be taken to the detail page for that cold chain equipment item. If not, you'll see a notification telling that no match was found.

<div class="note">You can print a QR code label for an equipment item. See the <a href="/docs/coldchain/equipment/#printing-a-qr-code">Print QR code</a> section for details</div>

### Create new asset

Cold chain assets can be created manually with the `New Asset` button.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/docs/coldchain/images/create_asset_button.png" width="150" height="55">
</p>

Clicking this button will open the `Create Asset` modal

With this modal you can assign:

- set the store for the asset (only available on the Open mSupply central server)
- the asset category
- the asset catalogue item the asset will be based on: this will link information from the catalogue item ( such as manufacturer & model ) to this newly created asset
- the asset number
- notes about the asset

If the asset you are creating is not part of either the `WHO PQS` or `General` catalogue, you can use the toggle to create an asset which is not based on a catalogue item.

![Create asset modal](/docs/coldchain/images/create_asset_modal.png)

### Managing cold chain assets

Clicking on a row in the list will show the details of that asset. If your asset is under the `Refrigerators and freezers` category, then you will see extra information such as the energy source and storage volume (capacity of the fridge or freezer catagorised by the temperature of the item).

![Asset detail view](/docs/coldchain/images/asset_detail_view.png)

There are 4 tabs available to manage the asset:

![Detail view tabs](/docs/coldchain/images/asset_detail_view_tabs.png)

#### Summary tab

From the `Summary` tab, you can:

- edit the serial number
- assign an installation date
- assign a replacement date
- assign locations to the the asset

<div class="tip">Multiple locations can be assigned to one asset</div>

You can also view the functional status and edit notes on the status.

#### Details

The `Details` tab shows the asset properties.

![](/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_detail.png)

#### Status Logs

The `Status Logs` tab shows all of the status logs of the asset.

![Asset logs tab](/docs/coldchain/images/status_logs_tab.png)

#### Documents

The `Documents` tab shows documents which have been uploaded for the asset catalogue item the asset belongs to, and the documents uploaded for this asset.

Additional documents can be uploaded for this asset.

![Asset documents tab](/docs/coldchain/images/documents_tab.png)

<!--
TODO: Add link to central server docs when they are created
-->

Documents which are uploaded here will synchronise to the central server, though not as a part of the usual sync process. Files will only be sent when there is no other information to synchronise, which means that adding documents won't cause delays in shipments or stock showing up.

#### Log

The `Log` tab shows the activity log of this asset.

This records all user actions which have been taken for this asset using the Open mSupply system.

### Toolbar

#### Update Status

Clicking on the `Update Status` button allows the creation of a new status log.

![](/docs/coldchain/images/update_status_button.png)

This will open a new status log modal.

![](/docs/coldchain/images/status_log_modal.png)

Here you can enter:

- A new functional status
- A reason for the new functional status
- Any observations or notes

Additional documents including photos can also be uploaded for this status log

![](/docs/coldchain/images/status_log_document_upload.png)

These documents can be viewed in the `Status Logs` tab

![Status log document](/docs/coldchain/images/status_log_document.png)

#### Printing a QR code

To help identify assets, you can print a QR code label for your asset. This can then be scanned (see above) to easily identify an asset in your system.

Simply click the `Print QR code` button and a QR code will be printed, if you have a label printer configured.

To configure a label printer, refer to the [Label Printing](/docs/settings/devices/#label-printing) section of the settings pages.

The label will show the code and serial number, for example:
