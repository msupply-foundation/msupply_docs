## Language

There are two ways to change the language in Open mSupply:

#### 1. **Using the Footer (Main Method)**

To change the language, you can select a language from the drop-down list in the footer. The language you select will only affect youâ€”each user can select the language they prefer to view.

If store properties have been configured for your Open mSupply system, you will also see an `Edit` button next to the store selector, where you can [view and edit your store properties](/docs/manage/facilities/#editing-your-store-properties):

#### 2. **Through the Configuration Settings**

Alternatively, you can change the language by going to the `Settings` section. From there, simply select a language from the drop-down list. This selection will only affect you, and the language will be used across the site.

##### **Viewing the Configuration Settings**

The configuration settings section allows you to configure custom data for the system. It is only available on the [Open mSupply Central Server](/docs/5a_clientserver/5a-2-omscentral/).

To view the configuration settings, go to `Settings` in the lower section of the navigation panel:

If you are on the Open mSupply Central Server, you will see this list of settings sections:

Click on the `Configuration` section to begin.

The selected language will persist even after you reload the page, open a new tab, or return to the site later. However, if you switch to a different browser (e.g., Firefox after changing the language in Chrome), you will need to select the language again.
