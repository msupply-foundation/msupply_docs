#### Is there support for my currency?

You can configure the currency symbol shown when displaying prices. You can also configure foreign currencies which allows you to send and receive shipments in a currency different to your main currency. To configure foreign currencies follow [these instructions](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:currencies) in the central server documentation. You will also need to enable the store preference `Store: Able to issue in foreign currency`. This preference is compatible with Open mSupply `v1.7.0+`.
