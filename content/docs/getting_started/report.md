The reports page gives you an overview of the reports available in Open mSupply.
You can access the reports page by clicking on the `Reports` menu item.
![goto_report](/docs/getting_started/images/goto_report.png)

You will be presented with a list of reports that you can generate. The reports
listed below are the standard reports and will already be set up for you. If
you need a custom report, please contact mSupply support at [support@msupply.foundation](mailto:support@msupply.foundation).

![report list](/docs/getting_started/images/report_list_view.png)

The reports are generated based on preferences which are set up in the mSupply
central server. See [report
preferences](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:virtual_stores?s[]=threshold&s[]=overstock#notification_preferences)
for more information about what these preferences are and how to set them up.

You can view these preferences by clicking on the `More` button.

## Generating reports

Click on the report you want to generate. For this example, we will generate the
`Stock Status` report.

Click on the `Stock Status` report.
![stock status](/docs/getting_started/images/goto_stock_status.png)

You will be presented with a form where you can edit the filter criteria used by the report. Leave unchanged to display all items for the report.

For the `Stock Status` report, you can filter the report based on the following criteria:

- `Item Name`
- `Item Code`

If you enter values for both the code and name, the items shown would have to match **both** criteria i.e. entering a code of `01` and a name of `am` would only show items with a code that contains `01` and a name that contains `am`.

The form also display which preferences the report is based on.

![stock status filter](/docs/getting_started/images/report_filter.png)

Click `Ok` to generate the report. If you find that you would like to narrow
down the report while viewing it, you can click on the `Filter` button on the
top right corner of the report which will open up the filter form again.

A print preview window will open showing you what will be printed and allowing

using `control`+`P` (if using windows) or `cmd`+`P` keys on your keyboard (if
