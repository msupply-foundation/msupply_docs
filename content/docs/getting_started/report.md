## Reports

The reports page gives you an overview of the reports available in Open mSupply.
You can access the reports page by clicking on the `Reports` menu item.
![goto_report](/docs/getting_started/images/goto_report.png)

You will be presented with a list of reports that you can run. The reports
listed below are the standard reports and will already be set up for you. If
you need a custom report, please contact mSupply support at [support@msupply.foundation](mailto:support@msupply.foundation).

![report list](/docs/getting_started/images/report_list_view.png)

The reports are generated based on preferences which are set up in the mSupply
central server. See [report
preferences](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:virtual_stores?s[]=threshold&s[]=overstock#notification_preferences)
for more information about what these preferences are and how to set them up.

You can view these preferences by clicking on the `More` button.

## Generating reports

Click on the report you want to generate. For this example, we will generate the
`Stock Status` report.

Click on the `Stock Status` report.
![stock status](/docs/getting_started/images/goto_stock_status.png)

You will be presented with a form where you can filter out the report based on
certain criterias or display all items for the report. For the `Stock Status`
report, you can filter out the report based on the following criterias: `Item
Name` and `Item Code`. The form also
displays what preferences the report is based on.

![stock status filter](/docs/getting_started/images/report_filter.png)

Click `Ok` to generate the report. If you find that you would like to narrow
down the report while viewing it, you can click on the `Filter` button on the
top right corner of the report which will open up the filter form again.

browser tab. This can then be printed using your browser by clicking print or
using `control`+`P` (if using windows) or `cmd`+`P` keys on your keyboard (if
using a mac).

### Exporting a report
