### What is Returns?

**Returns** refers to the process of receiving goods back from customers or returning goods back to the supplier. This can occur for various reasons, such as damaged items, incorrect orders, or overstock. Returns are an important part of inventory management, as they help ensure that the inventory system reflects the correct stock levels, and that returned products are properly accounted for, inspected, and restocked if necessary.

There are many different ways to return goods with Open mSupply, either through the order they were originally received via [Inbound Shipment Returns](/docs/19_returns/19-2-returnsinboundshipment/), or through the order it was sent from via [Outbound Shipment Returns](/docs/19_returns/19-3-returnsoutboundshipments/), or even manually if you are not sure which order it came from.
