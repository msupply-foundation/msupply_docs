## Migration from Legacy mSupply (Central or Desktop Remote Sites)

For those who are currently using Legacy mSupply, we are currently working through testing the migration process and the integration of Open mSupply with an existing mSupply system. As such, we aren't recommending that you upgrade without talking to us first.

## Migration from mSupply Mobile

For those who are currently using mSupply Mobile, all features in mSupply Mobile (except for vaccine vial wastage, VVM statuses and ADR reporting) are available on Open mSupply. This means that you will be able to migrate to Open mSupply to continue your operations, additionally with enhanced functionality and without losing any key capabilities. If you have any questions or would like further updates on any of the missing functionality, please reach out to our team.
