The display settings section allows you to customise how the site looks for you. Changes made will only affect your experience - if other people would like to change the logo, for example, they will have to make the change themselves.

Let's explore what's possible...

## Viewing the display settings

To view the display settings, go to `Settings` in the lower section of the navigation panel:

![Location: nav](/docs/settings/images/admin_nav.png)

You will see the list of settings sections:

![Admin: collapsed](/docs/settings/images/admin_collapsed.png)

You will see the `Display settings` at the top, click on this to view the options:

## Language

To change the language, you simply have to select from the drop down list.

![Language](/docs/settings/images/change_language.png)

The selected language will be used for everything you do on the site. If you reload the page or open a new tab, this language will be used. However if you view the site in a different browser (for example Firefox after changing the language in Chrome) you will need to select the language again.

## Custom logo

It is possible to use a custom logo for the site. This shows in the left navigation and on the login screen. For example:

![Custom logo login](/docs/settings/images/custom_logo_login.png)

![Custom logo login](/docs/settings/images/custom_logo_nav.png)

The logo will need to be in the `svg` format. To update, simply

- enable the custom logo by clicking the toggle switch
- copy the text of the .svg file and paste it into the text area
- click save

## Custom theme

You can also configure a custom look for your site by using a custom theme. To do this:

- enable the custom theme by clicking the toggle switch
- you'll see a sample of the current theme in the text area - this shows you what can be updated
- edit the theme and click save to view the results
