# Presentation

## What are mSupply dashboards ?

The mSupply dashboard retrieves data from the software and presents it in a series of visual indicators and reports to facilitate decision-making. Any data synchronised with the central server can be  exported and either visualised directly on the dashboards or used to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) displayed on them. They are updated in real time as the central server is synchronized, ensuring users always have access to the most current data.
## What are dashboards used for ? 

mSupply dashboards are designed for decision-makers at all levels who need tailored reports, historical data, gaps analyses, and high level decision making tools - all without the need to install or use mSupply softwares. 

Here are some sample dashboards with example data. Feel free to explore them :
### Facility level nurses
They can use the <a href="https://vaccines.msupply.org:3000/d/zSJ53_FSz/remote-temperature-monitoring?orgId=1" target="_blank">remote temperature monitoring:</a> dashboard to monitor temperature logs  by facility and sensors, prevent breaches and protect temperature sensitive medicine.

### Regional warehouse managers 
They can use the <a href="https://demo-board.msupply.org:3000/d/I0V-Q9S4k-2024/stock-availability?orgId=1" target="_blank">stock availability</a> and the <a href="https://demo-board.msupply.org:3000/d/WsTax_UJK/expiring-stock?orgId=1" target="_blank">expiring stock</a> dashboards to monitor critical items availability and reduce wastage, the  <a href="https://demo-board.msupply.org:3000/d/3LThcikVz/health-facility-orders?orgId=1&from=now-2y&to=now" target="_blank">list of orders placed</a> dashboard to manage orders and shipments to lower level facilities.

### National level decision-makers 
When there is an interest in knowing how well a vaccination campaign is going for instance, mSupply dashboards can display a map of doses administered per region with different colours according to the % of objective realised for instance. Another example of clinical data is the <a href="https://demo-board.msupply.org:3000/d/ZqgoeeIVz/prescription-statistics?orgId=1&from=now-1y&to=now" target="_blank">prescriptions statistics</a> per facility dashboard. 

**### How are dashboards set up ?

mSupply dashboards are hosted on the web-based open source platform <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>, which means they can be accessed from any device with a working internet connection. They are specific to a project (i.e a datafile) and can only be accessed with a registered username and password. They are highly customisable including the level of information each user has access to.**


#### Store login permissions to determine data visibility

The dashboards can be configured such that data visibility is controlled according to the store login permissions of the user. This can be an efficient way of managing dashboards. Instead of having a large range of very similar dashboards where the only difference between them is the user / store who's data is visible, you can have just one dashboard, where different users will see data according to the stores which they have permission to log in to.

#### Flexibility

You can view and share data from your dashboard, change the appearance and type of data the panels in your dashboard show, and create new dashboards customised to suit your needs.

For a detailed overview refer to Grafana Dashboard Concepts

#### Setting up Users

You can login to the dashboard using your current mSupply login. An account is created for you automatically in the grafana system with standard viewer-level permissions. If you are to have an editor or administrator role, then Sustainable Solutions, or another administrative user, can set that up for you after you have logged in for the first time.

To use the dashboard, an mSupply user must be configured to:

1. Use the Dashboard.

![Use the dashboard permission!](Presentation/images/mSupply_permission_dashboard.png)

2. Have Active status enabled.

![User must be set to Active!](Presentation/images/active_user_permission.png)

3.  If your dashboard is filtering store data according to the user's permission to log in to the store (recommendethen you will need to: \* Enter an email address for the user.
    ![User email address entered!](Presentation/images/email_user_entered.png)

         * Configure the user to be able to log in to the stores for which you want them to have access.

![Logging into stores permission!](Presentation/images/permission_can_log_in.png)

Other than these, no other special configuration of the mSupply user account is required - including any permissions in any of the stores.

<div class="note">
Valid Grafana user names are more restrictive than mSupply. For example, if the mSupply user name contains a hyphen (-) then Grafana will not accept that user name.
    John Doe **is** valid
    John-Doe **is not** valid
</div>

Users may need to have their mSupply username, which was working perfectly, amended in order for them to be able to log in to the Dashboard.

### Logging In

Users log in by entering the URL address of dashboard on a web browser.

The oauth (mSupply login) app requires something that Internet Explorer doesn't support. You must use another browser to log in to the mSupply dashboards.

Also, just STOP USING Internet Explorer - it's dangerous!

When you log in you may see a suite of dashboards similar to the example below.

This example is showing the 'Overview' Dashboard.
It is set to a Time Range of 'Previous year'
This Dashboard example contains six Panels:

- Total stock value
- Stock status
- Stock value by store
- Transactions per store
- Months of stock by region
- Stock history over time by store
