### Time range controls

The Time Range controls the data you can see at the Dashboard-level and at the Panel-level.

To view or change the Time Range, in the top right click on the Dashboard time picker (looks like a clock face). This shows the current dashboard time and refresh interval. It also acts as the menu button to toggle the time range controls.
