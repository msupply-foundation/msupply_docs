| **Panel**                 | Each dashboard is composed of panels or building blocks that display a specific piece of data with a visual element (gauge, table, graphs). <br><br>Panels arranged on a grid, are separated by rows and can be dragged-and-dropped to a different location on the grid.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Dashboards Collection** | When referring to dashboards, it is important to note that there usually is more than one dashboard page per project datafile. The main link typically directs users to a designated welcome page, but once inside Grafana, users can easily navigate between different dashboards.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Dashboards folder**     | mSupply dashboards are organised in folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Dashboard page**        | A single dashboard sitting on one page - most of the time, this is what is referred to when mentioning “dashboard”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Dashboard Reports**     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **mSupply Table**         | In Grafana, there is a type of table called mSupply Table that has an Export blue button at the bottom right of a panel. Users can download the table directly in excel and keep the layout of the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Variables**             | Most values are categorised under a general label (for instance the value Waikato is under the label “region”). <br><br>A variable is the general label pulled from your datafile so that all the values under can be displayed in the dashboard. It is then used as filters to display specific data. <br><br>It can either be already defined in your datafile or built as a query in your dashboard (for instance, “facility is a district warehouse and a dispensary” filter. |
| **Filters**               | Filters are at the top of the dashboard, they narrow down the degree of information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
