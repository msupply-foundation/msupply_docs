`notify` is a notification system that can be used to send emails and Telegram messages from mSupply or any postgres database.

It's designed so that different plugins can be built to support different types of notifications.

Currently there are two plugins:

- [Scheduled Reports](/notify/scheduled)
- [Cold Chain](/coldchain/cold-chain-notifications)

They operate fairly independently of each other, but both use the same underlying notification system.

## Scheduled Reports

Allows the user to schedule reports to be sent to them at a specified time these reports can contain data using SQL queries from the configured database.

## Cold Chain

Cold Chain has a specialised configuration for [cold chain](/coldchain/introduction) alerts.
The user can select the sensors they want to monitor and the temperature ranges they want to be alerted on.
