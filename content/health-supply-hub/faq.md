## The Manufacturer I want to bid with is not available in the list. What should I do?

Please email health-supply-hub@msupply.foundation with the list of any manufacturers you want to use in your quote or fill out the request form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv8Mmin1SXuJwD7MDALEYb648Nrb_XvLpBUer8YIhdwR9NpA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

In the mean time, please enter "Manufacturer Not On List" in the manufacturer field and include the real manufacturer name in the comment field so the purchaser can update their records when the manufacturer is added.

## What user role should I assign to my team members?

There are two user roles that can be assigned to users.

- `OrganisationAccess` gives a user the right to login to your organisation, upload documents, and submit bids/quotes.
- `OrganisationAdmin` adds user administration rights such as the ability to invite other users to the organisation, reset passwords, update names etc.

## I manage two companies with different portfolios of products. How is this scenario managed in Health Supply Hub?

When submitting a quote you should submit under the legal entity /organisation that would be legally responsible for supplying that product.
Therefore each company/legal entity should be registered on HSH, you'll need to login with a different user account for each organisation.

A separate username and password is required for each organisation, if you'd like help setting this up, please contact `health-supply-hub@msupply.foundation` for assistance.

## My Personalised Link To Register Has Expired. What Do I Do?

Please note that the HSH invite link expires after a short period of time and you will get an error if you click the link after it has expired.

1. If an administrator of your organisation created the link for you in HSH, they can generate another by resetting your password.
2. If you are the only administrator of your organisation, you can contact HSH support to receive a new link.

## When I Try To Upload My Quote I Get An Error Message. What Do I Do?

HSH is designed to guide you through identifying where errors are in your quote template. HSH will tell you which row on the Excel spreadsheet contains the error:

![Error Message - Pack Size Not A Whole Number](/health-supply-hub/images/faq_import_error.png)

In the above example, on Row 9 of the imported excel sheet this supplier:
a. has submitted something other than a whole number eg ‘1 tube’; and
b. has not entered in the manufacturer details.

## I Want To Offer More Than One Product For A Particular Quote Item. How Do I Do That?

1. To offer more than one product for a particular Quote line you will need to insert an additional line to your Quote. You can do this by inserting a new row directly below the Quote Item you want to offer more than one product for, or add it in at the bottom of the list.

![Right Click on Line, and copy it](/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_1.png)
![Paste Line](/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_2.png)

2. Whatever row you choose to use to add in your additional product be sure to copy over the information for that Quote line that has been prefilled by the mSupply Tender module. This is required for HSH to be able to read your quote. Without it you will get an error when trying to upload your Quote to HSH
3. Don’t drag the information down into the new row. A common error that can occur is that any cell value ending in a number will be increased by one as shown in the example below:
   ![Accidental increment](/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_3.png)
4. The best method is to copy and paste the information directly from the original Quote line into your new Quote line

## I Want To Offer To Supply A Product By Either Sea or Air Freight. How Do I Do That?

1. To propose supply via Sea Freight AND Air Freight for the same item you will need to enter in two separate Quotes for the same product.
2. See the section above on how to enter in an additional quote for the same Quote Item
