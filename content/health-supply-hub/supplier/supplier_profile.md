A Supplier Profile is a public page to display information about your organisation to prospective purchasers.

This is an optional feature of Health Supply Hub, which will help purchasing organisations more easily select the best suppliers to invite to tender for specific products.

### Setting up your Supplier Profile

Navigate to Organisation on the sidebar to view your organisation profile.

This will take you to your supplier profile. From here you are able to offer information that might be helpful to purchasing organisations.

When your organisation profile is ready, set the toggle to public so that purchasers are able to view it.

<div class="note">
    Setting your organisation to private does not affect your organisations ability to submit quotes to tenders. Purchaser organisations can also still invite your organisation to tenders.
