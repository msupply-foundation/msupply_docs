### Tips

- Additional users can be added to your organisation after your organisation registration is complete.

- Once registered, Administrators can login into their account and add as many additional Users to their organisations as required.

- Password and login details should not be shared across multiple Users

- Additional Users can be set up by Administrator Users, and new Users will be prompted to change password upon accessing the e-portal for the first time

- The emailed link sent to reset a User’s password will expire so ensure that the User is ready to be registered when you add them
