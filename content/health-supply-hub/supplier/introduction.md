[Health Supply Hub (HSH)](https://health-supply-hub.msupply.org/) is a web-based platform to facilitate procurement of medical supplies.

HSH is designed to integrate closely with the mSupply software allowing mSupply users to easily create tenders &amp; RFQs based on the products they use and need.
Developed in partnership with [Indo-Pacific Health & Supply Chain Data & Technical Assistance Centre (DTAC)](https://msupply.foundation/projects/DTAC), the Health Supply Hub aims to streamline processes such as tender pre-qualification and product evaluation, and to provide a centralised mechanism for suppliers to view and respond to tenders and RFQs.
