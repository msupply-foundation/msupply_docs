Welcome to Health Supply Hub (HSH). HSH is a web-based platform to facilitate procurement of medical supplies.
HSH is designed to integrate closely with the mSupply software allowing mSupply users to easily create tenders based on the products they use and need.
Developed in partnership with Indo-Pacific Health & Supply Chain Data & Technical Assistance Centre (DTAC), the Health Supply Hub aims to streamline processes such as tender pre-qualification and product evaluation, and to provide a centralised mechanism for suppliers to view and respond to tenders and RFQs.
