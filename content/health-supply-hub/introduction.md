#### Background

Traditional tender processes are often very time consuming and prone to errors. Health Supply Hub integrates with the mSupply Tender Module to simplify and streamline the tender and RFQ process and minimise errors in procurement through its web-based management system. Advanced planning is essential, as tender processes usually start several months before required goods are on site and available to use.

#### What is Health Supply Hub

Health Supply Hub is a platform that assists in the tender process by extending the functionality of the mSupply Tender module through its web-based tender management platform. It facilitates the easy upload and management of tenders created within mSupply and allows for efficient communication and transparency among suppliers.

Purchasers create tenders on mSupply and upload the tender to Health Supply Hub. Suppliers view these tenders and upload their quotes for items they wish to bid on. They are also able to ask questions and obtain clarification with the purchaser. Once quotes have been uploaded by the supplier, this is downloaded back to the mSupply Tender module where it can be reviewed by the purchaser and successful bidders chosen.

[Health Supply Hub (HSH)](https://health-supply-hub.msupply.org/) is a web-based platform to facilitate procurement of medical supplies.

HSH is designed to integrate closely with the mSupply software allowing mSupply users to easily create tenders &amp; RFQs based on the products they use and need.
Developed in partnership with [Indo-Pacific Health & Supply Chain Data & Technical Assistance Centre (DTAC)](https://msupply.foundation/projects/DTAC), the Health Supply Hub aims to streamline processes such as tender pre-qualification and product evaluation, and to provide a centralised mechanism for suppliers to view and respond to tenders and RFQs.
