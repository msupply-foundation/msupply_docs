Health Supply Hub is a web based platform to facilitate procurement of medical supplies.
Itâ€™s designed to integrate closely with the mSupply software allowing mSupply users to easily create tenders based on the products they use and need.

Developed in partnership with DTAC (Indo-Pacific Health & Supply Chain Data & Technical Assistance Centre), Health Supply Hub aims to streamline processes such as tender pre-qualification and product evaluation, and to provide a centralised mechanism for suppliers to view and respond to tenders and RFQs.
