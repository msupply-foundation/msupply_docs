The Homepage contains a Sidebar menu on the left. By default, Health Supply Hub opens in the Tender view. The tenders (1) appear in the order of the closed or nearest closing date. Tenders may also be filtered by status (2) or by the tender closing date period (3). The user logged in is located at the bottom of the webpage (4).

##### Statuses

The tender statuses are located at (5). These statuses include:

|           |                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Draft     | Tender is waiting to be reviewed and published         |
