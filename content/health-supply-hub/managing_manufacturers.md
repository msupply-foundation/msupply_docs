The Health Supply Hub maintains list of manufacturers to select from. If the manufacturer you require is not on the list, please fill out the manufacturer request form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv8Mmin1SXuJwD7MDALEYb648Nrb_XvLpBUer8YIhdwR9NpA/viewform?usp=sf_link), or if you have a number of manufacturers to add, please email `health-supply-hub@msupply.foundation` attaching the list of manufacturers to add.

While waiting for the updated manufacturer list, or if pressed for time. You can enter "Manufacturer Not On List" in the manufacturer field and include the real manufacturer name in the comment field so the purchaser can update their records when the manufacturer is added.
