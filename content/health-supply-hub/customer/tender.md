#### Creating a tender on mSupply

Tenders are created on mSupply through the Tender module. For further information on how to do this, see the [mSupply Tender Module Training Guide 2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aZOy6aDVvtKFRtG7SezpMOofSCoHrFD4/view?usp=drive_link)

#### Tender process

After a tender has been created on mSupply and then uploaded to Health Supply Hub, this will appear in “Tenders” with the status “Draft” (1).

The uploaded tender displays an overview of supplier interest on the tender (2):

| Invited           | Amount of suppliers you have invited to bid/quote on your tender |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Registered        | Amount of suppliers who have registered (given interest) to bid  |
| Confirmed         | Amount of suppliers who have sent in a bid/quote                 |
| Total quote lines | Amount of item lines in total quoted by suppliers                |

Draft tenders cannot be viewed by the supplier. Before publishing a draft tender, ensure all details are correct as changes cannot be made afterwards. Publishing the tender (3) will make it live for suppliers to see and place bids. Once the tender is published, the status will change to “Open” (4). If you would like to withdraw your published tender, select “Withdraw tender” (5). If you withdraw your tender, a prompt will appear to provide a reason which will be sent to suppliers for withdrawing the tender.

Reasons that are provided for withdrawn tenders are published in “Reason” (6). Once the tender is withdrawn this will also be removed for the supplier.

The types of statuses a tender can have include:

| Draft     | Tender has not yet been published                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open      | Tender is published and live for suppliers to bid                   |
| Closed    | Tender has exceeded the closing date and no more bids can be placed |
| Withdrawn | Tender has been withdrawn                                           |
