<div class="warning">

The Mobile app dashboard is completely different to the [mSupply Grafana web dashboard](/dashboard/introduction) and is configured in a different manner.

</div>

<div class="tip">
Dashboard reports will be visible in the mSupply Mobile dashboard provided that on the mSupply central server:

  * The [store preference](/mobile/setup/server-setup/#other-preferences) is turned on for the store 
  * The report has been [configured for display on mSupply Mobile stores](/mobile/setup/dashboard/#mobile-specific-dashboard-configuration)
  </div>

Once it has been enabled you will be able to see the Dashboard icon on the mSupply Mobile Menu page.
