**Check the store is working via mSupply Desktop**

  * On the Primary server, log in to the new Store. 

If you are already logged in to mSupply Desktop you can switch to the new Store via the **File menu > Switch** [<img src="/_media/en:mobile:setup:server_side:pasted:20200203-055400.png" class="mediaright" loading="lazy" alt="" />](/_detail/en:mobile:setup:server_side:pasted:20200203-055400.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Asetup%3Aserver_side%3Areview_setup)

  * Check that the correct Items/Master List(s) are visible

**Start the web server**

**Remember:** the syncing of the store only works when the  [web server](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/web_interface:using_the_web_server) is running!
