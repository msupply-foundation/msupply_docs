An example:
a medical centre, called Ami CHC, sends an order to your facility. They are doing an outreach tour to households in a nearby village and would like to collect some items to take.

The **customer** is Ami CHC

They have ordered:

  * Amoxicillin 500mg tabs x 11
  * Paracetamol 500mg tabs x 100
  * Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml x 50

**Let's create a customer invoice**

----
### Add items to the customer invoice

You can add items to the customer invoice one by one - to do this, tap on **New Item**.

[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_new_item.png?w=800&amp;tok=e78f8c" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_new_item.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

Start typing to search for the item.
[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:search_item.png?w=800&amp;tok=d1403b" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:search_item.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

If you have a lot of items to add to the invoice, it can be slow to add them one by one.

To add a lot of items at once, click **Add Master List Items**.
[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_add_master_list_items.png?w=800&amp;tok=166c2a" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_add_master_list_items.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

Select one or more master lists from the list. Only master lists visible to the customer are shown.

[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:select_master_list.png?w=800&amp;tok=2d69d9" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:select_master_list.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

The items on the selected master list(s) will then automatically appear in the customer invoice.

----
### When you have finished

Click the **Finalise** button at the top, and then **Confirm**.
----### What is a Master List?

The list is set  by your supplier and/or the Ministry of Health.
