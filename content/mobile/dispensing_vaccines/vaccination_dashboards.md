## Vaccination Monitoring Dashboards

If you are using mSupply mobile for registering participants, dispensing vaccines, and recording adverse events, then you need a mechanism to report on all this information, and to manage your program.
The mSupply dashboard is your friend. We have created a series of dashboards specifically for these tasks.

Here's an example:

Here the dashboard shows a list of people needing to be contacted for their 2nd dose (This can be exported to excel and uploaded to an SMS sending service to send a reminder).
