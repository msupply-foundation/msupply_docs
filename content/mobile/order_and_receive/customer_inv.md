An example:

The **customer** is Ami CHC.

They have ordered:

  * Amoxicillin 500mg tabs x 11
  * Paracetamol 500mg tabs x 100
  * Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml x 50

If you have a lot of items to add to the invoice, as it can be slow to add them one by one.

To add a lot of items at once, click **Add Master List Items**.

![Custom invoices button on Navigator](/mobile/introduction/images/customer_invoice_add_master_list_items.png)

Select one or more master lists from the list. Only master lists visible to the customer are shown.

![Custom invoices button on Navigator](/mobile/introduction/images/select_master_list.png)

The items on the selected master list(s) will then automatically appear in the customer invoice.
