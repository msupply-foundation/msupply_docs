If you have a problem with the stock supplied and need to return something, you can do this against the **Supplier Invoice**. 

<div class="tip">
To use this feature, the preference for the supplier credit module needs to be enabled for your store.
</div>

Let's go through each step:

### Click on Supplier Invoices

A list of Supplier Invoices will appear. Click on the toggle (highlighted) to select **Past** invoices. You can only return items against a **finalised** invoice.

### Click on the Supplier Invoice for the order you have received

This will open the Supplier Invoice. 

If the invoice has stock which can be credited, then the button which normally allows adding of items is renamed **New supplier credit** and is for returning items.

Click on **New supplier credit** to begin

### Enter quantities to return

Enter the quantity for each item you want to return. You do not need to return all items nor the whole quantity of an item.

Select a **supplier credit category** using the list at the top left of the screen.
