<p>Restricted tendering is a procurement method that limits the request for tenders to a select number of suppliers, contractors, or service providers. This method of procurement is also called: Closed Tendering, Limited Bidding and Selective Tendering.</p>
<p>With Restricted Tenders it is at the sole discretion of the Purchaser as to which suppliers they want to invite to participate in their procurement process.</p>
<p>Currently Health Supply Hub is set up for Purchaser to issue restricted tenders only. Open tendering via HSH is currently under development.
Even after this feature is developed purchasers may choose to issue restricted tenders.</p>
<h4 id="your-responsibilities">Your Responsibilities<a class="zola-anchor" href="#your-responsibilities" aria-label="Anchor link for: your-responsibilities">🔗</a></h4>
<p>You must ensure that you have engaged with the relevant Purchaser so that they know you have an interest in supplying for them. Not all procurements are openly advertised.
Each Purchaser may have different requirements for new suppliers to be invited to their supply requests. You should contact the relevant staff at the relevant Purchasing Agency to understand their specific needs.</p>
<p>Information that you may be required to provide to a Purchaser includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your finances and your ability to manage financial risks.</li>
<li>Information about your capacity to supply.</li>
<li>Information about your human resources and qualification of your staff.</li>
<li>Information about your previous experience in supplying the same or similar goods in similar settings to that of the Purchaser’s settings.</li>
<li>References</li>
</ul>

<p>It is your responsibility to review Requests from Purchasers on HSH. If you are interested in a particular request for supply, you should click the ‘Register to Quote’ button to ensure any further correspondence related to that opportunity will be sent to you and to enable the upload quote functionality.</p>
<p>It is your sole responsibility to engage with the relevant Purchaser to indicate your interest in supplying for them.</p>

<li>Once you login the first page that will open is the ‘Tenders’ Page. Any new and open tenders that your organisation has been invited to will appear at the top of this page. All Tenders your organisation has been invited to will be displayed on this page in chronological order of the Tender Deadline Date or ‘Closing Date.’</li>

<ol>
<li>If you need to correct any errors in your quote you can do so by Uploading a new Quote to HSH before the ‘Closing Date’</li>
<li>To support timely evaluation of your offer we suggest that you attach your supporting document in a zip file that contains separate folders for each Quote Item.</li>
<li>We highly recommend suppliers submit their quotes well before the notified deadline. This ensures that should there be any unforeseen issues with your submission there is adequate time to troubleshoot. Please note that Purchasers will not be able to see any quotes prior to the deadline.</li>
