<p>In the mean time, please enter &quot;Manufacturer Not On List&quot; in the manufacturer field and include the real manufacturer name in the comment field so the purchaser can update their records when the manufacturer is added.</p>

<p>There are two user roles that can be assigned to users.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>OrganisationAccess</code> gives a user the right to login to your organisation, upload documents, and submit bids/quotes.</li>
<li><code>OrganisationAdmin</code> adds user administration rights such as the ability to invite other users to the organisation, reset passwords, update names etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>When submitting a quote you should submit under the legal entity /organisation that would be legally responsible for supplying that product.
Therefore each company/legal entity should be registered on HSH, you'll need to login with a different user account for each organisation.</p>
<p>A separate username and password is required for each organisation, if you'd like help setting this up, please contact <code>health-supply-hub@msupply.foundation</code> for assistance.</p>
<h2 id="my-personalised-link-to-register-has-expired-what-do-i-do">My Personalised Link To Register Has Expired. What Do I Do?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#my-personalised-link-to-register-has-expired-what-do-i-do" aria-label="Anchor link for: my-personalised-link-to-register-has-expired-what-do-i-do">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Please note that the HSH invite link expires after a short period of time and you will get an error if you click the link after it has expired.</p>
<ol>
<li>If an administrator of your organisation created the link for you in HSH, they can generate another by resetting your password.</li>
<li>If you are the only administrator of your organisation, you can contact HSH support to receive a new link.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-i-try-to-upload-my-quote-i-get-an-error-message-what-do-i-do">When I Try To Upload My Quote I Get An Error Message.

<p>HSH is designed to guide you through identifying where errors are in your quote template. HSH will tell you which row on the Excel spreadsheet contains the error:</p>
<p><img src="/health-supply-hub/images/faq_import_error.png" alt="Error Message - Pack Size Not A Whole Number" /></p>
<p>In the above example, on Row 9 of the imported excel sheet this supplier:
a. has submitted something other than a whole number eg ‘1 tube’; and
b. has not entered in the manufacturer details.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-offer-more-than-one-product-for-a-particular-quote-item-how-do-i-do-that">I Want To Offer More Than One Product For A Particular Quote Item.

<ol>
<li>To offer more than one product for a particular Quote line you will need to insert an additional line to your Quote. You can do this by inserting a new row directly below the Quote Item you want to offer more than one product for, or add it in at the bottom of the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_1.png" alt="Right Click on Line, and copy it" />
<img src="/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_2.png" alt="Paste Line" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Whatever row you choose to use to add in your additional product be sure to copy over the information for that Quote line that has been prefilled by the mSupply Tender module. This is required for HSH to be able to read your quote. Without it you will get an error when trying to upload your Quote to HSH</li>
<li>Don’t drag the information down into the new row. A common error that can occur is that any cell value ending in a number will be increased by one as shown in the example below:
<img src="/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_3.png" alt="Accidental increment" /></li>
<li>The best method is to copy and paste the information directly from the original Quote line into your new Quote line
<img src="/health-supply-hub/images/faq_duplicate_line_4.png" alt="Paste New Line" /></li>

<p>The portal will generate an email notification to all registered users when your organisation is invited to bid on a tender.
It is up to the respective Purchaser to determine whether their Request for Supply is open or restricted.
If the purchaser decides to issue a restricted supply request it is up to the Purchaser to determine the supplier selection and the selection criteria used.
Health Supply Hub is intended to be used for both open/public procurement as well as closed/restricted procurement processes.</p>

<p>Your company only needs to register once with Health Supply Hub to access tenders from countries using the Health Supply Hub system.
It is the sole discretion of the Purchaser to determine whether its process is open or restricted, and if restricted which suppliers they invite.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-submit-bids-quotes-via-health-supply-hub">How do I submit bids/quotes via Health Supply Hub?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#how-do-i-submit-bids-quotes-via-health-supply-hub" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-do-i-submit-bids-quotes-via-health-supply-hub">🔗</a></h2>
<p>See the <a href="/health-supply-hub/submitting-bids/">Submitting Bids</a> page for more information on how to submit a bid via Health Supply Hub.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Purchasers may also expect suppliers provide supplementary information for their Evaluation processes, this may be at the product level (eg User Manuals, GMP certificates) and company level (eg information about your company’s structure, performance and experience). Purchasers may indicate the additional information they require within the quote template and through their own supplementary documentation in the ‘Tender documents’ section.</p>
