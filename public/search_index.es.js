Sin embargo, tienes la posibilidad de emitir una cantidad de paquetes en su lugar cambiando el valor en el segundo menú desplegable (Tamaño del PAquete). \nEl valor predeterminado es  Cualquiera cuando emites unidades. \n\nLista de lotes disponibles:🔗\nEsta es una lista de números de lote que tienes en tu inventario para este artículo:\n\nLote: Número de lote. Es una designación dada a los productos fabricados en la misma carrera de producción. \nVencimiento: Fecha de vencimiento del lote (formato: MM/AAAA)\nUbicación: Si tu inventario se gestiona con ubicaciones de almacenamiento, el nombre de la ubicación donde se almacena el artículo\nTamaño del paquete: Cantidad de unidades por paquete\nPrecio de venta por paquete: Precio de venta por unidad del artículo\nEn espera: Indica si un lote está en espera o no. No puedes emitir un lote que está en espera. \nEn inventario (paquetes): Total de paquetes en tu inventario\nDisponibles(paquetes): Número de paquetes disponibles (que no están asignados a otros envíos)\n[Unidad] Cantidad emitida: Cantidad total de unidades a emitir\nCantidad de paquetes emitidos: Número de paquetes a emitir\n\nTambién hay una última fila en la tabla que es una línea de marcador de posición, si el estado del envío de salida esNUEVO.\nLa línea de marcador de posición se utiliza cuando la cantidad que se emite es mayor que tu inventario disponible.\n\nEmitir una cantidad de unidades🔗\nPor defecto, se le invita a emitir una cantidad de unidades, independientemente del tamaño del paquete (número de unidades en un paquete).\nAl ingresar un número en el campo Emitir, después de hacer clic en el botón Asignar, el sistema elige automáticamente el/los número(s) de lote con la fecha de caducidad más cercana (lógica de Primero en Caducar, Primero en Salir o FEFO). \n\nEn el siguiente ejemplo, emitiremos 10 unidades del artículo. Las 10 unidades se tomarán de la misma partida (tercera fila). Las dos primeras partidas no fueron seleccionadas porque han caducado.\n\n\n\nEn este otro ejemplo, emitiremos 100 unidades. El sistema selecciona tres lotes con diferentes tamaños de paquete.\n\n\nTen en cuenta que en esta lista, las partidas que están disponibles para su selección se muestran primero y las partidas que no lo están (en espera o sin stock disponible) se muestran abajo y en fuente gris.\nEmitir una cantidad de paquetes🔗\nPuedes decidir emitir una cantidad de paquetes. Para hacerlo, puedes cambiar el valor en el menú desplegable Tamaño del paquete. \n\nImaginemos que tu cliente solo quiere un tamaño de paquete de 25 unidades. Puedes cambiar el valor del menú desplegable de  `Cualquier` a `25`. \n\n\nAhora se te ofrece la posibilidad de emitir un número de paquetes de 25 unidades. Solo se pueden emitir automáticamente los números de lote que tengan un tamaño de paquete de 25 unidades.\n\nEn el siguiente ejemplo, estamos emitiendo 5 paquetes de 25 unidades:\n\n\n\n si previamente has ingresado una cantidad de unidades y cambias a una cantidad de paquetes, la cantidad de unidades se convertirá automáticamente en la cantidad correcta de paquetes.  \n\n\nCuando se selecciona un tamaño de paquete, las líneas de stock que tienen un tamaño de paquete diferente no están disponibles para seleccionar. Por lo tanto, esas filas se enumeran más abajo en la tabla y se muestran en una fuente gris, de la misma manera que otras filas no disponibles.\nAsignación Manual🔗\nIndependientemente de si has elegido emitir una cantidad de unidades o paquetes, siempre puedes cambiar manualmente la cantidad en el nivel del número de partida directamente antes de presionar OK. \nSimplemente tienes que ingresar o editar la cantidad en la columna Cantidad de paquetes emitidos. \nLos valores en la fila Total se actualizarán automáticamente con la nueva cantidad.\n\n  cuando asignas cantidades en el nivel del número de partida, la cantidad que ingreses siempre será una cantidad de paquetes. \n\n\n\nAsignación manual a nivel del número de lote.\n\nEmisión cuando no hay suficiente stock (Línea de reserva)🔗\nSi la cantidad a emitir es mayor que el total de stock disponible de todas las líneas disponibles, entonces la cantidad a emitir se colocará automáticamente en el campo de reserva, en la parte inferior de la lista de números de partida disponibles. \nLas líneas de reserva se pueden asignar más tarde cuando llegue nuevo stock. Sin embargo, todas las líneas de envío deben asignarse antes de confirmar la asignación.\n\nDado que no hay stock disponible para 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml,  el sistema emitirá 100 unidades en el campo de reserva. \n\n\nCuando revisas una salida, puedes ver si una línea de envío no ha sido asignada o ha sido parcialmente asignada cuando se resalta en azul. \n\nConfirmar artículo y cantidad🔗\nCuando estés satisfecho con la cantidad, puedes presionar:\n\nel botón OK.  Serás redirigido a la vista de Salida y el artículo se habrá agregado a la lista. \nel botón OK &amp; Siguiente para agregar otro artículo inmediatamente.\nel botón Cancelar  si no deseas agregar el artículo al envío de salida.\n\nAgregando líneas a un envío de salida usando una lista maestra🔗\nHaga clic en el botón Agregar desde la lista maestra (esquina superior derecha). \n\nSe abre una nueva ventana de Listas Maestras. Esto le permite seleccionar la lista maestra requerida. Simplemente haga clic en una de las listas (si tiene alguna disponible).\nTenga en cuenta que las listas que se muestran son aquellas que son visibles para el cliente del envío.\n\nHaga clic en OK en la ventana emergente:\n\nLuego se agregarán líneas no asignadas (reserva) a su envío, que se verán así:\n\nComo puede ver, todas las cantidades son cero. Puede seguir los pasos para editar estas líneas, como se detalla arriba.\nEditar una línea de salida🔗\nPara editar una línea de envío, selecciónela. Se abrirá la ventanaEditar Artículo, que es idéntica a la ventana Agregar Artículo, excepto que el artículo ya está seleccionado. \nEditar una línea de envío🔗\n\n  puede editar una línea de envío si el estado del envío es inferior a Enviado. \n\n\n\nAbra la salida que desea editar. \n\n\nHaga clic en la línea que desea editar. Aparece una ventana idéntica a Agregar Artículo. En esta etapa:\n\nEdite el campo principal de Emitir Cantidad \no cambie el valor de la cantidad de paquetes en el nivel de número de lote\n\n\n\n\n  Al editar una línea de envío, no puede cambiar el artículo. Deberá eliminar la línea de envío y crear una nueva. \n\nEliminar una línea de envío🔗\n\nAbre la salida que quieres evitar.\nSelecciona la(s) línea(s) que deseas eliminar marcando la casilla(es) a la derecha de la lista. \nVe al menú desplegable Acciones (esquina superior derecha, encima de la lista).\nSelecciona la acción Eliminar las líneas seleccionadas\n\n\n\nEn el siguiente ejemplo, estamos eliminando e artículo 030063 - Tabletas de ácido acetilsalicílico de 100 mg\n\n\n\n  Puedes eliminar varias líneas a la vez. Asegúrate de revisar lo que está seleccionado antes de realizar la acción de eliminación. \n\nProcesar una salida🔗\nAsignar una salida🔗\nLa asignación es el proceso de asignar uno o varios números de lote del inventario a una línea de envío. En otras palabras, estás asignando inventario a tu envío. Una vez asignado, el inventario está reservado para el envío y, por lo tanto, para tu cliente.\nHay 2 formas principales de asignar una línea de envío:\n\n\nAl agregar artículos, el sistema asigna automáticamente inventario a la nueva línea de envío cuando ingresas una cantidad. Si no tienes suficiente inventario, el sistema agregará líneas de marcador de posición (líneas no asignadas).\n\n\nAcción en masa Asignar líneas de marcador de posición: \n\nSelecciona las líneas que deseas asignar marcando las casillas a la derecha en la lista.\nEn el menú desplegable Acciones, selecciona Signar líneas de marcador de posición. El sistema verificará si hay inventario disponible para cada línea seleccionada y las asignará utilizando la lógica del primero en caducar, primero en salir (FEFO). Una notificación te informará si la operación se realizó con éxito o no.\n\n\n\n\nNo podrás procesar tu salida si tienes líneas no asignadas (líneas de envío sin número(s) de lote asignado(s)) con una cantidad mayor que 0. Puedes esperar a que llegue más stock o puedes eliminar las líneas de marcador de posición. Cualquier línea no asignada con una cantidad de 0 se eliminará automáticamente cuando asignes.\n\nConfirmación de asignación de una salida🔗\nUna vez que todas las líneas de envío han sido asignadas, puedes confirmar la asignación:\n\nconfirmar la asignación NUEVO\nLas líneas deben estar asignadas con uno o varios números de lote. No podrás confirmar la asignación si tu envío contiene líneas sin números de lote asignados (líneas de marcador de posición).\n\nPara confirmar la asignación, presiona el botón Confirmar asignado. \n\nUna vez confirmada la asignación:\n\nEl estado del envío es ASIGNADO\nAhora se te invita a confirmar la selección de artículos mediante el botón Confirmar seleccionados\nTodos los artículos y sus cantidades estarán reservados, lo que significa que ya no están disponibles para la asignación\nPuedes imprimir una hoja de recogida para enviar a tu almacén para que puedan empezar a preparar el envío\n\nConfirmar el alistamiento de la salida🔗\nEl término \"picking\" se refiere al proceso en el que se recogen los artículos individualmente de una instalación de cumplimiento (por lo general, un almacén o una farmacia).\nUna vez que se ha asignado un envío, el siguiente paso es ir a buscar los artículos para preparar el envío real. Para ayudar con esto, se puede generar un documento de lista de recogida. Una lista de recogida indica:\n\nQué artículos se deben recoger\nLa cantidad y los números de lote para cada artículo\nSi gestiona su inventario con ubicaciones de almacenamiento, dónde se encuentran los artículos\n\nUna vez que se han recogido y empacado todos los artículos, puede confirmar la preparación del envío para indicar que está listo para ser despachado. \nPara confirmar que se ha preparado un envío, haga clic en el botón Confirmar Recogido. \n\nUna vez confirmado el alistamiento:\n\nEl estado del envío es ahora RECOGIDO\nAhora se te invita a confirmar el envío a través del botón  Confirmar Envío \nSe ha generado una entrada Entrada y ahora es visible para tu cliente\n\nEn este momento, todavía puedes editar las líneas del envío, agregar o eliminar elementos. Sin embargo, si se ha confirmado el picking, debes asegurarte de informar a tu centro de cumplimiento de cualquier cambio para que puedan asegurarse de que el envío siga siendo correcto.\nConfirmar el envío de una salida🔗\nEl último paso para emitir el stock con un Salida es confirmar que se ha enviado el stock. Este es un paso crítico porque cuando los bienes se confirman como enviados, ya no forman parte de los registros de su inventario.\nPara confirmar que se ha enviado una salida, haga clic en el botón Confirmar envío. \nUna vez que se ha confirmado el envío: \n\nEl estado del envío es ahora ENVIADO\nLos bienes ya no forman parte de su inventario\nYa no puede editar las líneas de envío\nYa no puede eliminar el envío\nPuede imprimir una nota de entrega o una factura\n\nSeguimiento al progreso de las salidas🔗\nSi su cliente también utiliza mSupply, podrá ver cuándo recibirán sus envíos:\n\nel estado se convertirá en ENTREGADO cuando los bienes sean recibidos: su cliente confirmó que recibió sus bienes\nel estado se convertirá en VERIFICADO cuando el envío haya sido verificado por su cliente. Los bienes ahora forman parte de su inventario\n\nVer una salida🔗\nCuando se visualiza un envío específico, se pueden ver los lotes en ese envío agrupados por ítem o con cada lote listado por separado.\nPara cambiar el modo de vista, haz clic en el botón Agrupar por artículo. \nCuando se agrupa por árticulo, se puede expandir el artículo para ver lotes individuales, o utilizar la expansión en el encabezado de la tabla para expandir todas las filas agrupadas. Si haces clic en un artículo, también verás todos los lotes seleccionados, como se muestra en este ejemplo:\n\nSi no tienes suficiente espacio en la pantalla, o simplemente no estás interesado en algunas de las columnas mostradas, tienes la opción de ocultar qué columnas se muestran en esta vista.\nHaz clic en el botón Mostrar / ocultar columnas, que está en la parte superior derecha de la tabla. Esto da una lista de las columnas disponibles; puedes marcar las columnas que deseas ver. Las opciones elegidas se almacenan para el navegador actual, por lo que la próxima vez que veas una salida, solo verás las columnas seleccionadas. Si has elegido qué columnas mostrar, entonces el botón se muestra en azul para recordarte que hay más columnas disponibles.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/distribution/outbound-shipments/","title":"Salidas"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/distribution/outbound_shipments/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/distribution/outbound_shipments/","title":"Salidas"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/distribution/requisitions/":{"body":"Cuando un cliente te hace un pedido de inventario, ellos crean una  Oden Interna en su almacén.

El cliente puede ser un navegador web, una tableta Android o una PC con Windows o Mac OS. El servidor requiere un poco más de memoria y capacidad de procesamiento, dependiendo del número de usuarios. Puede ejecutarse en sistemas operativos Windows, Mac o Linux.\nRequisitos de hardware🔗\nRecomendaciones generales de hardware🔗\n\n\nEn entornos con cortes de energía regulares, se recomienda encarecidamente adquirir computadoras portátiles en lugar de computadoras de escritorio. Las computadoras portátiles serán casi siempre la mejor solución en términos de costo y eficacia por las siguientes razones::\n\nEn entornos con suministro eléctrico de baja calidad, las computadoras portátiles generalmente serán más confiables que las computadoras de escritorio con protección UPS. En tales entornos, las baterías UPS normalmente morirán dentro de los 2 años. Las baterías de las computadoras portátiles tienen un mejor manejo de energía y duran más.\nIncluso cuando se agota la batería de una computadora portátil, la administración de energía normalmente hará que la máquina se apague correctamente.\nLas computadoras portátiles tienen micrófono y cámara incorporados para proporcionar soporte.\nLas computadoras portátiles tienen un adaptador Wi-Fi incorporado para la conexión de red.\nLas computadoras portátiles son más pequeñas y livianas que las computadoras de escritorio, por lo que son menos costosas de enviar.\n\n\n\nNo es absolutamente necesario tener una impresora conectada en todas las situaciones, pero en la mayoría de las situaciones es un requisito. Es preferible una impresora de inyección de tinta o láser.\n\n\nAdquiera hardware para el cual haya un buen soporte postventa disponible\n\n\nAdquiera marcas con reputación de calidad (incluso si significa comprar una máquina más lenta / antigua)\n\n\nRequisitos de hardware de Windows, Mac y Linux🔗\nLos requisitos de hardware varían ampliamente según para lo que desee usar Open mSupply. Aquí hay una guía aproximada:\nMáquinaMínimo técnicoRecomendado\nMáquina cliente Windows para usar con servidorProcesador de 64 bitsWindows 104 Gb de RAM, 300Mb de espacio en discoProcesador de 64 bitsWindows 108 Gb de RAM, 500Mb de espacio en disco\nMáquina cliente Mac para usar con servidor6Procesador de 64 bitsmacOS Mojave (10.14) - macOS Big Sur (11) (se requiere la última versión principal, como 10.14.6)4 Gb de RAM, 300Mb de espacio en discoProcesador de 64 bitsMac OS 10.14.6 o posterior8 Gb de RAM, 500Mb de espacio en disco\nServidor WindowsProcesador de 64 bitsWindows 10 Pro o Win server 20198 Gb de RAM50 GB de volumen HDD / SDD con copiasProcesador de 64 bitsWindows Server 2019+8 Gb RAM4 x volúmenes HDD/SDD, 3 configurados como RAID1 o RAID5 con repuesto en calienteCopias de seguridad diarias al cuarto volumen más copias de seguridad diarias fuera del sitioConectado a un Smart UPS (ver abajo)\nCliente o servidor LinuxProcesador de 64 bitsUbuntu 20+ o similar4 Gb de RAM256 Gb de almacenamientoProcesador de 64 bitsUbuntu 20+ o similar8 Gb de RAM256 Gb de almacenamiento\nCliente o servidor AndroidProcesador de 64 bitsAndroid 10 o posterior4 Gb de RAM64 Gb de almacenamientoProcesador de 64 bitsAndroid 10 o posterior4 Gb de RAM64 Gb de almacenamiento\n\n\nLa gestión de transacciones de inventario es una función fundamental en Open mSupply. Dado que la mayoría de los datos de estas transacciones son numéricos, contar con un teclado numérico puede resultar muy útil en aquellas máquinas donde se ingresa una gran cantidad de información.\n\nRequisitos para tabletas / móviles🔗\nPuedes usar un navegador en una tableta para conectarte a un servidor de Open mSupply, y el único requisito es una tableta lo suficientemente rápida con un navegador como Chrome o Firefox. \nPara una solución independiente y sin conexión, también está disponible una aplicación móvil para dispositivos Android.\nEspecificaciones recomendadas:\nEn resumen, Open mSupply Mobile funciona en tabletas Android (no en teléfonos, ya que hay demasiados datos para usar bien en pantallas pequeñas de teléfonos).\nLa aplicación requiere al menos Android 5.0 (Lollipop).\nMínimoRecomendado\nTamaño de pantalla9.8 pulgadas10.1 pulgadas\nResolución768 x 1024 pixeles800 x 1200 pixeles\nVersión de Android5.08.1\nProcesadorQuad-core 1.3GHz\nMemoria1.5 Gb de RAM\n\nPara proporcionar soporte, el dispositivo también debe ser compatible con el software de gestión de dispositivos móviles (MDM) y admitir los servicios de Google. Comunícate con mSupply Foundation para obtener más detalles.\nPor favor, contáctanos para pruebas y / o consejos antes de realizar una gran compra de hardware.\nUPS inteligente🔗\nUna 'UPS inteligente' (Sistema de Alimentación Ininterrumpida)  (Uninterruptible Power Supply) detecta cuándo la batería está a punto de agotarse y envía una notificación al software del servidor que desencadena un cierre adecuado del ordenador. Para ello, debe haber una conexión por cable (normalmente USB) entre el UPS y el ordenador, combinado con un software que se ejecute en el ordenador.\nEn nuestra experiencia, la principal causa de fallos en el hardware del ordenador es la corrupción de datos debido a los apagones inesperados. Esto ocurre cuando se corta instantáneamente la alimentación del ordenador sin ninguna notificación para que se apague correctamente. Si la máquina está 'protegida' por un UPS normal, esto aún puede suceder cuando se agota la energía de la batería. Incluso si la máquina está protegida por un UPS 'inteligente', hay varias circunstancias en las que esta protección falla:\n\nLa conexión por cable y el software pueden fallar.\n\nEl cable se desconecta\nEl software no está configurado correctamente\nEl software no se inicia\n\n\nLas baterías del UPS se degradan (normalmente en un plazo de 2 años desde la instalación en entornos con cortes de energía regulares) y hay muy poca capacidad para ejecutar el tiempo suficiente para que el ordenador se apague correctamente después de recibir la notificación del UPS.\n\nLos ordenadores portátiles tienden a ser mucho más resistentes a los fallos de energía:\n\nEl UPS 'inteligente' integrado en un portátil es muy fiable\nLas baterías internas duran mucho más que las del UPS\nIncluso si la batería interna del portátil se degrada, la función 'inteligente' parece funcionar de manera mucho más fiable que una UPS independiente que se comunica con un ordenador de escritorio\n\nAquí hay algunas ventajas adicionales de los portátiles frente a los ordenadores de escritorio:\n\nMenor costo de envío:\n\nPara enviar la máquina al lugar\nPara enviar piezas de repuesto para la reparación en el lugar\nPara recuperar la máquina del lugar en caso de reparaciones que no se puedan realizar en el lugar\n\n\nEs habitual que los portátiles tengan características como Wi-Fi, Bluetooth y cámara incluidas por defecto, lo que puede no ser el caso de los ordenadores de escritorio.\n\nUna preocupación con los ordenadores portátiles es la seguridad. Es más fácil robar un portátil de una oficina que un ordenador de escritorio. Por esta razón, los portátiles suelen estar configurados con una característica de bloqueo físico como Kensington lock slot.\nDebido a que Open mSupply está tratando con muchos números (cantidades de stock), es muy recomendable tener un teclado con un teclado numérico. Los portátiles más pequeños (pantalla de 14 \"o menos) no tendrán esto. Los portátiles más pequeños suelen tener una pantalla imprácticamente pequeña. Por lo tanto, se recomienda adquirir un portátil con un teclado que incluya un teclado numérico, lo que necesariamente implicará una pantalla más grande.\nAccesorios útiles para aumentar la productividad en computadoras portátiles incluyen:\n\nRatón externo (no inalámbrico - la sustitución de baterías es costosa y problemática para el medio ambiente)\nTeclado externo (no inalámbrico - la sustitución de baterías es costosa y problemática para el medio ambiente)\nPantalla externa\n\nSistema de copia de seguridad🔗\nUna vez que empieces a utilizar Open mSupply, es crucial tener un método para realizar copias de seguridad de tus datos. En una instalación por defecto, Open mSupply almacena todos sus datos en un archivo que rápidamente se vuelve grande. Por lo tanto, es necesario tener un dispositivo de almacenamiento extraíble de alta capacidad. Recomendamos encarecidamente el uso de un disco duro externo utilizando Firewire (IEEE 1394) o USB2 para facilitar el almacenamiento externo de copias de seguridad.\n\nSi no se utiliza nuestro servicio de copia de seguridad en línea, es necesario poder almacenar los datos de copia de seguridad en un lugar externo para evitar el riesgo de pérdida por incendio, robo, etc.\n\nAntivirus🔗\nLos sistemas operativos basados en Windows son particularmente propensos a los malware si no se toman precauciones. Recomendamos las siguientes precauciones:\n\nInstalar un programa antivirus confiable, incluyendo protección web si la computadora tiene acceso a internet\nDesactivar los puertos USB - consulta este sitio para conocer métodos sugeridos.\n\nAsegúrate de mantener seguras las contraseñas para permitir excepciones a las dos medidas anteriores.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/introduction/requirements/","title":"Requisitos"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/introduction/roadmap/":{"body":"Este mapa de ruta se actualizará aproximadamente cada seis semanas y solo cubre nuestro flujo de trabajo comprometido inmediato.

Actual"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/introduction/tutorial/":{"body":"Tutorial Open mSupply🔗\nEste tutorial está diseñado para guiarte a través de los conceptos básicos del uso de Open mSupply.\nInicio de sesión🔗\n\nEn primer lugar, deberás abrir tu navegador web. Nosotros recomendamos Firefox, pero Chrome y sus muchos derivados también son suficientes.\nIntroduce la dirección web (URL) de tu servidor mSupply. En nuestro caso, estamos utilizando https://demo-open.msupply.org - nuestro sitio web de prueba.\nDespués de presionar  en tu teclado, se te mostrará la página de inicio de sesión.\n\n\n\nIngresa tu nombre de usuario y contraseña y presiona  en tu teclado o haz clic en el botón [Iniciar sesión].\n\nSi todo va bien, serás redirigido a la página del tablero de control. \nSi hubo un problema, verás un mensaje de error como este:\n\nIntenta volver a escribir tu nombre de usuario y contraseña. Recuerda que ambos son sensibles a las mayúsculas y minúsculas. Una vez que hayas iniciado sesión, se seleccionará automáticamente el almacén predeterminado de tu usuario. Si tienes acceso a otros almacenes, podrás cambiar entre ellos después de iniciar sesión (ver más abajo).Si ya has iniciado sesión antes y has cambiado de almacén, se seleccionará automáticamente el almacén más reciente cuando inicies sesión de nuevo.\nNavegación🔗\nEl menú principal se encuentra en el lado izquierdo de la pantalla. Si tienes una pantalla pequeña, por defecto estará colapsado - en pantallas más grandes estará abierto por defecto.\nPara abrir y cerrar el menú puedes hacer clic en el logo en la parte superior, como se muestra a continuación. Una vez que hayas seleccionado una opción, el menú permanecerá abierto o cerrado.\nSi el menú está cerrado, simplemente pasar el cursor sobre los elementos del menú lo abrirá, en cuyo caso al hacer clic en un elemento, el menú se cerrará de nuevo. Si estás en una tablet, hacer clic en un elemento del menú tendrá el mismo efecto.\n\nEn algunas pantallas verás que el encabezado muestra un título, como Salida in the example above. en el ejemplo anterior. Al hacer clic en un envío específico, el título cambiará a Salida/ #[número de envío]. Puedes hacer clic en la parte Salida para volver a la lista o utilizar la navegación principal a la izquierda.\nAtajos de teclado🔗\nHay atajos de teclado utilizados en todo Open mSupply. En lugar de recordarlos todos, para empezar solo tienes que recordar la combinación control (ctrl)+k (windows y linux) o cmd (⌘)+k (mac).\nEsto te mostrará la siguiente ventana, sin importar en qué página te encuentres:\n\nEsto te muestra la lista de atajos disponibles globalmente, por ejemplo, presionar d en tu teclado te llevará al tablero de control (¡a menos que estés escribiendo texto en un campo de entrada!).\nSin embargo, también puedes hacer clic en un elemento de la lista o buscar comandos disponibles:\n\nAdemás, hay varios lugares donde están disponibles los atajos de teclado específicos. Un ejemplo es el control de pestañas utilizado tanto en Inventario como en Entradas. Aquí puedes usar control+1 para navegar a la primera pestaña (Cantidades) ocontrol+2  para la segunda pestaña (Precios), etc. Si presionas+ en tu teclado, puedes agregar un nuevo lote.\n\nPie de página🔗\nEl fondo de la pantalla contiene información útil y se muestra en todas las pantallas.\n\nAlgunos usuarios tienen acceso a más de un almacén. Para cambiar el almacén que está actualmente seleccionado, simplemente haz clic en el nombre del almacén en el pie de página:\n\nVerás la notificación y el nombre del almacén en el pie de página se actualizará. A partir de ahora, todas las acciones se realizarán en el almacén recién seleccionado.\nDe manera similar, puedes seleccionar otro idioma haciendo clic en el idioma actual en el pie de página:\n\n¡Ayuda!🔗\nSi te quedas atascado en cualquier momento al utilizar el sitio, haz clic en el elemento del menú Docs.\n\nEsto te llevará a la página de documentación que se relaciona con la página actual que estás viendo.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/introduction/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/inventory/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/inventory/","title":"Inventario"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/inventory/stock-takes/":{"body":"mSupply automáticamente llevará un registro de tus niveles de stock a medida que lo recibas y lo distribuyas. Sin embargo, a veces se ingresan datos incorrectamente o el stock se agota sin que se realice una entrada en el sistema.\nPor supuesto, intentamos evitar que esto ocurra, pero si sucede, podemos corregirlo. La forma más fácil de corregir errores es hacer un Toma de inventario. \nEn mSupply, puedes realizar fácilmente un inventario para: \n\nTodo el inventario\nUn rango limitado de artículos\nA Un solo artículo\n\nVer el listado de tomas de inventario🔗\nPara ver tus recuentos de stock, ve a Inventario y luego a Tomas de inventario en el panel de navegación: \n\nEsto muestra una lista de todos tus tomas de inventario: \n\nPor cada toma de inventario puedes ver:\n\nEl número de la toma de inventaqrio\nEl estado de la toma de inventario. Existen dos estados de toma de inventario: \n\nNuevo: una toma de inventario en la que te encuentres trabajando\nFinalizado: una toma de inventario que ya se ha llevado a cabo. Ya no la puedes editar.\n\n\nUna descripción de la toma de inventario (por ejemplo, Toma de inventario de marzo)\nSi lo hay, un comentario sobre la toma de inventario\nLa fecha de la verificación de inventario\n\n\nNo tiene mucho sentido mantener antiguas tomas de inventario con estado = NUEVO, especialmente si estás a punto de crear una que contiene los mismos elementos. De hecho, puede ser bastante peligroso dejar antiguas tomas de inventario con estado  NUEVO en tu sistema. Si ha pasado un tiempo desde que se creó la toma de inventario, es casi seguro que las cantidades de la instantánea y las cantidades reales sean incorrectas. Por razones de limpieza, es una buena práctica eliminar las antiguas tomas de inventario NUEVO.\n\nCrear una nueva toma de inventario🔗\nEmpecemos una toma de inventario. Para esto, da clic en el botón Nueva Toma de Inventario en la esquina superior derecha. \n\nAparecerá una ventana, donde puedes optar por crear una toma de inventario basada en elementos de una lista maestra, inventario en una ubicación particula o una toma de inventario vacía:\n\nHaz clic en aceptar cuando hayas seleccionado la opción que deseas. \nLuego se creará la toma de inventario y las líneas de stock existentes se utilizarán para poblar los valores de lote, vencimiento, tamaño de paquete y número de instantánea de paquetes. Las líneas se muestran en color azul claro y cambiarán a negro cuando se ingrese un valor para la cantidad contada.\nNo es posible editar el tamaño del paquete de las filas del inventario que están vinculadas a una línea de inventario existente. Si desea cambiar el tamaño del paquete, deberá eliminar la fila y agregar una nueva fila o filas según sea necesario..\n\n\nNo te preocupes si un elemento falta en tu nueva toma de inventario. Después tendrás la posibilidad de agregar más elementos a tu toma de inventario. \n\nIngresar razones🔗\nSi tienes opciones de ajuste de inventario configuradas en su servidor central, se te pedirá que ingreses una razón cuando el  número de paquetes contados  especificado no coincida con el número de paquetes en la toma instantánea. \nPor ejemplo, ingresar 100  para la cantidad contada de Salbutamol, agregará un asterisco rojo a la derecha del campo Razón  y mostrará las razones de ajuste de inventario negativas:\n\nSi intenta guardar la fila del inventario sin ingresar una razón, se mostrará un error:\n\nPrinting Stocktake sheet🔗\nAl ver una toma de inventario específica, simplemente haz clic en el botón Imprimir que se encuentra en la parte superior derecha de la página.\nAl imprimir, se genera un archivo PDF para ti, que se abrirá en una nueva pestaña del navegador. Luego, esto se puede imprimir usando tu navegador haciendo clic en imprimir o utilizando las teclas  control+P (si usas Windows) ocmd+P en tu teclado (si usas un Mac).\n\nEsto mostrará\n\nUn menú de posibles informes para que selecciones antes de crear un archivo PDF. Esto ocurrirá si hay más de un informe definido para el tipo de informe Toma de inventario\nCreará un archivo PDF de inmediato si solo hay un informe para seleccionar\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/inventory/stock-takes/","title":"Tomas de Inventario"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/es/docs/inventory/stock-view/":{"body":"Una de las tareas más importantes pero más fáciles en mSupply es verificar cuánto stock tienes disponible.
