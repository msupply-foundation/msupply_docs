can be sent for hot and cold temperature breaches and an additional notification can be sent to warn users if the system is not currently receiving data from the temperature sensors. \nThe instant message mediums currently supported are: \n\nTelegram Messenger\n\nTelegram Messenger notifications for mSupply Cold Chain🔗\nNote: To enable Telegram Messenger notifications mSupply Cold Chain must be used in conjunction with mSupply Desktop or Open mSupply. \nTelegram Messenger is a free application that can be used on Android or iOS phones and tablets. \nIt can also be used on Windows, Linux and Mac computers. \nmSupply Cold Chain notifications are broadcast on dedicated Telegram channels. \nChannels are very configurable - they can broadcast notifications from a single facility or they can broadcast from multiple facilities. They can broadcast from a single piece of Cold Chain Equipment (CCE) within a facility or they can broadcast from multiple pieces of CCE within a facility. \nUsers can subscribe to a single Telegram channel or they may subscribe to multiple Telegram channels, depending on their monitoring requirements. \nHere are some example configurations that are achieveable with mSupply Cold Chain: \nA single Telegram channel receiving notifications from all CCE at all facilities.🔗\nThis configuration allows for notifications for all CCE at all facilities to be broadcast to a single Telegram channel. \nAll users in this scenario have subscribed to this single channel and so all users will see all notifications from all CCE at all facilities. \n\nMultiple Telegram channels receiving notifications from all CCE at a single facility each.🔗\nThis configuration allows for separate Telegram channels for each facility. Users may subscribe to the facility that they are interested in monitoring. \nHere User 3 has subscribed to two channels. \n\nSetting up Telegram Messenger🔗\n1. Install Telegram Messenger🔗\nUsers must install the Telegram Messenger application .\n2. Create a user account🔗\nUsers must then create an account with Telegram. \nOnce the user account is created users can then subscribe themselves, or can be subscribed by admin users, to the mSupply Cold Chain Telegram channels that they wish to monitor.\nSetting up Telegram Messenger notifications for mSupply Cold Chain🔗\nThe following steps describe how to set up Telegram notifications for mSupply Cold Chain.\n1. Create a Recipient Telegram channel🔗\nA Telegram channel is the place where users will receive mSupply Cold Chain notifications. See above for illustrative channel examples. \n'Recipient' is the terminology used to describe someone or some thing that receives notifications. \nIn our case we want to create a Telegram channel that will receive notifications - thus a 'Recipient Telegram channel'. \n\nGo to Create new message in Telegram\nSelect 'New Channel'\nGive the channel an appropriate name, e.g. 'Cold chain alerts for Facility ABC'\nPress the tick icon\nSelect 'Private Channel'\nPress the arrow icon\n\nThe Recipient Telegram channel is now created.\n2. Add the mSupply notification bot to the Recipient Telegram channel🔗\nEach mSupply system has its own unique notification bot that serves to update the Recipient Telegram channel. \nNote: If you do not know the name of the mSupply bot for your system please contact support@msupply.foundation\nOnce the notification bot is added to the Recipient Telegram channel the channel is then linked to the mSupply system. \nThe bot must be added as an administrator user. \n\nClick on the title of the Telegram channel\nSelect 'Administrators'\nSelect 'Add Admin'\nSearch for and select the mSupply bot\nGrant the bot the default admin permissions\nPress the tick icon\n\nThe Recipient Telegram channel will now be visible in the Recipients section of the notifications configuration page. \n3. Create a Cold Chain Notification🔗\nThis is where we set up each Cold Chain Notification. \nA notification can be for a single facility, or it can be for all facilities in the system. See above for illustrative notification examples. \n\nIn the notifications configuration page click on the 'New Notification' button. \nSelect the type 'Cold Chain'\nGive the notification a meaningful name, e.g. 'Cold chain alerts for all CCE in Facility ABC'\nSelect the required Recipient Telegram channel (or channels)\nCheck the types of alert required (high, low temperature, no data etc)\nCheck the preferences (reminders, confirmation messages)\nSelect the sensors to be alerted on.

This User Guide contains external links to Grafana information pages to explain various concepts and how to edit your current dashboard and create new dashboards.\nDashboards and Panels\nEach Dashboard is composed of editable Panels arranged on a grid. The panels are separated by rows and can be dragged-and-dropped to a different location on the grid. Each panel queries your mSupply data to give you information in a visual form (graph, table etc).\nStore login permissions to determine data visibility🔗\nThe dashboards can be configured such that data visibility is controlled according to the store login permissions of the user. This can be an efficient way of managing dashboards. Instead of having a large range of very similar dashboards where the only difference between them is the user / store who's data is visible, you can have just one dashboard, where different users will see data according to the stores which they have permission to log in to.\nFlexibility🔗\nYou can view and share data from your dashboard, change the appearance and type of data the panels in your dashboard show, and create new dashboards customised to suit your needs.\nFor a detailed overview refer to Grafana Dashboard Concepts\nSetting up Users🔗\nYou can login to the dashboard using your current mSupply login. An account is created for you automatically in the grafana system with standard viewer-level permissions. If you are to have an editor or administrator role, then Sustainable Solutions, or another administrative user, can set that up for you after you have logged in for the first time.\nTo use the dashboard, an mSupply user must be configured to:\n\nUse the Dashboard.\n\n\n\nHave Active status enabled.\n\n\n\nIf your dashboard is filtering store data according to the user's permission to log in to the store (recommendethen you will need to:\n\n\nEnter an email address for the user.\n\n\n\nConfigure the user to be able to log in to the stores for which you want them to have access.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than these, no other special configuration of the mSupply user account is required - including any permissions in any of the stores.\n\nValid Grafana user names are more restrictive than mSupply. For example, if the mSupply user name contains a hyphen (-) then Grafana will not accept that user name.\n    John Doe **is** valid\n    John-Doe **is not** valid\n\nUsers may need to have their mSupply username, which was working perfectly, amended in order for them to be able to log in to the Dashboard.\nLogging In🔗\nUsers log in by entering the URL address of dashboard on a web browser.\nThe oauth (mSupply login) app requires something that Internet Explorer doesn't support. You must use another browser to log in to the mSupply dashboards.\nAlso, just STOP USING Internet Explorer - it's dangerous!\nWhen you log in you may see a suite of dashboards similar to the example below.\nThis example is showing the 'Overview' Dashboard.\nIt is set to a Time Range of 'Previous year'\nThis Dashboard example contains six Panels:\n\nTotal stock value\nStock status\nStock value by store\nTransactions per store\nMonths of stock by region\nStock history over time by store\n\n\nNavigation menus🔗\nLet's walk through the navigation menus\n\n\n\nOverview - This is the dashboard you are viewing.

A placeholder quantity is added automatically so that you can keep track of the amount requested, while adding more stock (for example by using an internal order or inbound shipment).\nThis image also shows the warning which lets you know that some stock lines are expired; this may be why the system did not auto-allocate particular stock lines. You can still manually choose those lines and issue the expired stock! It is just the auto allocation process which does not choose them.\n\nThis warning tells you that because of the available pack sizes, the system has rounded up the quantity requested. In this example, there is only five packs available of pack size 1. There are packs of 1000 available though, so when ten tablets are requested, the system has rounded up the request to 1 pack of 1000.\n\nIf you add an item forget to enter a quantity to issue, and click OK you will see this warning message.

As such, those rows are listed lower down in the table and are shown in a grey font, in the same way as other unavailable rows.\nManual Allocation🔗\nRegardless if you chose to issue a quantity of units or packs, you can always manually change the quantity at the batch number level directly before pressing on OK.\nYou simply have to enter or edit the quantity in the Packs Qty Issued column.\nThe values in the Total row will be automatically updated with the new quantity.\n\n  When allocating quantities at the batch number level, the quantity you enter is always a quantity of packs. \n\n\n\nManual allocation at the batch number level.\n\nIssuing when there is not enough stock (Placeholder Line)🔗\nIf the amount to be issued is greater than the total stock available from all of the available lines, then the quantity to be issued will automatically be placed in the placeholder field, at the bottom of the list of available batch numbers.\nPlaceholder lines can be allocated later when new stock arrives. However, all shipment lines must be allocated before confirming the allocation.\n\nSince there is no stock available for 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml, the system is issuing 100 units in the placeholder field. \n\n\nWhen you look at an Outbound Shipment, you can see if a shipment line has not been allocated or has been partially allocated when it is highlighted in blue.\n\nConfirm Item and Quantity🔗\nWhen you are happy with the quantity, you can either press on:\n\nthe OK button.

Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nProcessing an Outbound Shipment🔗\nAllocating an Outbound Shipment🔗\nAllocation is the process of assigning one or multiple batch numbers from the inventory to a shipment line. In other words, you are assigning stock to your shipment. Once allocated, the stock is reserved for the shipment and thus for your customer.\nThere are 2 main ways to allocate a shipment line:\n\n\nWhen adding items, the system will automatically assign stock to the new shipment line when you enter a quantity. If you don't have enough stock, the system will add placeholder lines (unallocated lines).\n\n\nBulk action Allocate placeholder lines:\n\nSelect the lines that you want to allocate by checking boxes on the right hand side of the list\nIn the Actions dropdown menu, select Allocate placeholder lines. System will check if there is available stock for each selected line and allocate them using the First to Expire, First Out (FEFO) logic. A notification will let you know whether the operation is successful or not.\n\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to process your Outbound Shipment if you have unallocated lines (shipment lines without batch number(s) assigned to them) with a quantity greater than 0. You can wait for more stock to arrive or you can delete the placeholder lines. Any unallocated lines with a 0 quantity will automatically be removed for you when you allocate.\n\nConfirming an Outbound Shipment's allocation🔗\nOnce all your shipments lines have been allocated, you can confirm the allocation:\n\nCurrent status of the shipment has to be NEW\nLines must be assigned with one or several batch numbers. You won't be able to confirm the allocation if your shipment contains lines without batch numbers assigned to it (placeholder lines).\n\nTo confirm the allocation, press the Confirm Allocated button.\n\nOnce the allocation is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is ALLOCATED\nYou are now invited to confirm the picking via the Confirm Picked button\nAll the items and their quantities will be reserved, meaning that they are no longer available for allocation\nYou can print a pick slip to be sent to your warehouse so they can start preparing the shipment\n\nConfirming Outbound Shipment picking🔗\nPicking refers to the process where individual items are picked from a fulfilment facility (usually a warehouse or a pharmacy store).\nOnce a shipment has been allocated, next step is to go get the items to prepare the actual shipment. To help with that, you are able to generate a pick slip document. A pick slip indicates:\n\nThe items to be picked\nThe quantity and batch numbers for each item\nIf you manage your inventory with storage locations, where the items are located\n\nOnce all items are picked and packed. You can then confirm the picking of the shipment to indicate that it is ready to be dispatched.\nTo confirm that a shipment has been picked, tap on the Confirm Picked button.\n\nOnce picking is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now PICKED\nGoods are no longer able to be allocated to other shipments\nYou are now invited to confirm the shipping via the Confirm Shipped button\nAn Inbound Shipment has been generated and is now visible to your customer\n\nAt this stage, you are still able to edit shipment lines, to add items or to delete existing lines. However, if picking has been confirmed, you need to make sure to inform your fulfilment facility of any change so they can make sure that the shipment is still correct.\nConfirming the Outbound Shipment shipping🔗\nThe last step to issue stock with an Outbound Shipment is to confirm that stock has been shipped. This is a critical step because when goods are confirmed as shipped, they are no longer a part of your inventory records.\nTo confirm that an Outbound Shipment has been shipped, tap on the Confirm Shipped button.\nOnce shipping has been confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now SHIPPED\nGoods are no longer part of your inventory\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\nYou can print a delivery note or an invoice\n\nTracking Progress of Outbound Shipments🔗\nIf your customer is also using mSupply, you will be able to see when they'll receive your shipments:\n\nstatus will become DELIVERED when goods are received: your customer confirmed that they received your goods\nstatus will become VERIFIED when shipment has been verified by your customer. Goods are now a part of their inventory.\n\nViewing an Outbound Shipment🔗\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch.\nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\nIf you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.\nClick on the Show / hide columns button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see. The options chosen are stored for the current browser, so next time you view an Outbound Shipment, you will see the selected columns only. If you have chosen which columns to show, then the button is shown in blue to remind you that there are more columns available.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound-shipments/","title":"Outbound Shipments"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound_shipments/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound_shipments/","title":"Outbound Shipments"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound_shipments/barcode-scanning/":{"body":"Adding items using a barcode scanner\nIf using the desktop or android apps, you have the option of scanning items in order to add them to the Outbound Shipment.\nIt is recommended to set the scanner to 'continuous scan' mode if it supports this.\nWe have been using Zebra USB scanners, model DS2208. Any hand held barcode scanner should work for this, though we may need to update to support different models. If you have another model of scanner, please get in touch.\nThe scanners support 1D and 2D barcodes, and can parse the information from a GS1 barcode in order to read the GTIN-14 code, batch number and expiry date.\nAs an example, barcodes could look like this:\n\n\nStarting the scanner\nTo begin, open the Outbound Shipment. If the status is New, Allocated or Picked you can start and stop the scanner using the Scan button:\n\nYou can also press the 'control (ctrl)' and 's' keys at the same time to start (and stop) scanning\nAdding items\nOnce the scanner is started you can scan items. Each time a barcode is detected by the scanner the Add Item window is shown. If the scanned barcode matches an item in your database then this item is automatically selected. When no match is made, the usual drop down selection is shown allowing you to select an item.\nIn addition, if the scanned barcode provides batch information and a match exists in your database, then all other batch lines are disabled, and the matching line is focused.\n\nAfter entering a quantity of the item, click Ok as usual.\nIn the case when the scanned barcode did not match any of the items in your database, this barcode is saved against the item selected in the Add item window. This means that the next time this particular item is scanned, it will correctly match an item.\nWhen using the desktop application, the scanner will continue accepting barcodes until you click the Scan button a second time. You can continue to scan items and enter their quantity until all items are added.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound_shipments/barcode-scanning/","title":"Barcode scanning"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/requisitions/":{"body":"When a customer orders stock from you, they create an Internal Order in their store.

Open mSupply is designed to be 'offline first' which means that users can continue to perform their daily operations without needing an internet connection. Occasional internet connectivity is required to sync data from remote sites to the central server. \nWhat are the limits to data handling?🔗\nThere are three aspects to this question with Open mSupply-\n\nRemote Sites are where you do day-to-day work.\nCloud hosted remote sites can be used when you have full time high quality internet.\nThe Central Server is where master data is managed, and where all data from remote sites is aggregated for reporting.\n\nRemote sites🔗\nOn a particular remote site, the database will be SQLite if running on Android, or usually Postgres if running a desktop server. We are assuming that if you have a busy site, you will upgrade to desktop (which is a painless process), so the Android limits are less relevant.\nType of recordRecord limit\nProducts&gt; 1,000,000\nTrade items&gt; 1,000,000,000\nUsersconfigured centrally - no practical limit at a site\nSuppliersconfigured centrally - no practical limit at a site\nTransactions&gt; 1,000,000,000\n\nCloud hosted remote sites🔗\nIf you host your remote site in the cloud, it can have thousands of connected users. The record limits are as above, but performance will be determined by available bandwidth both for the server and for each user's own internet connection.\nThe Central Server🔗\nThe Central Server uses Postgres, and aggregates all data from all sites, as well as being the master data server for Sites, Products (Items), Facilities, Suppliers and Users.\nType of recordRecord limit\nProducts&gt; 1,000,000\nTrade items&gt; 1,000,000,000\nUsers&gt; 100,000\nSuppliers&gt; 100,000\nSites&gt; 100,000\nTransactions&gt; 1,000,000,000\n\n(As of 2023 we are still to rewrite the central server as an open source project - the limits for the commercial mSupply central server are lower, but we still have sites with tens of millions of transactions, and growing fast. We don't expect any site to run into limits before we transition to an open source central server).\nCan you have multi-users on one Android tablet with Open mSupply?🔗\nYes!\nYou can have multiple users log into the one tablet.\nCan you have multi-stores on one tablet with Open mSupply?🔗\nYes!\nThe stores visible on each tablet at each site are configured centrally.\nWhen you log in you will see all stores that you have permission to log in to.\nIf you don't see a store you expect, check permissions on the central server and make sure the remote site has synchronised after updating permissions.\nCan you have multiple users on multiple Open mSupply tablets accessing the same store concurrently🔗\nYes!\nYou can also access an Open mSupply server running on an Android tablet from a machine running Open mSupply desktop or from a web browser on any device.\nFurther, Open mSupply \"publishes\" its availability on the local network, so you can log into the server without messing aroudn with IP addresses and the like.\nCan multiple people view/edit the same shipment/stocktake/requisiton at the same time🔗\nYes! Although the last edit will override previous edits if you both edit the same line at the same time. Stock integrity will be maintained though.\nAre there any concurrent license restrictions?🔗\nThere aren't any restrictions on the number of users connected to a server.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/images/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/images/","title":"Introduction Images"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/introduction/":{"body":"History🔗\nOpen mSupply builds on over 20 years of mSupply, over which time it has become the most used Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) in low &amp; middle income countries.\nWhat platforms are supported?🔗\nOpen mSupply runs on Desktop (Windows, Linux &amp; Mac), as a web application in your browser, or also as an Android application (for tablets, not for phones at this stage).\nWhere can I download it?🔗\nWe provide a number of downloads on our releases page hosted in our GitHub repository.\nThe latest version will be shown at the top of the list of releases - we generally recommend using the latest version where possible.\nWithin each release there is an Assets section which has the files you need to install Open mSupply.\nWindows🔗\nThere are installers built for each release, providing:\n\nServer: which supports either SQLite or postgreSQL and runs as a windows service. The installer name for the server is omSupply_Server_[version].exe\nDesktop: A windows application which allows you to connect to a running server. The installer name for the server is omSupply_Desktop_[version].exe\nStandalone: combines the above two; runs a server as a windows service and has a windows application which will connect to it.

Features include:\n\nInventory management\n\nEasily see per-batch stock on hand\nManage shelf locations for your store/warehouse\nAssign locations to incoming stock, or change locations as you rearrange stock in your warehouse\nPerform stocktakes, and assign reasons for inventory adjustments\nRepack stock\n\n\nReceive and fulfil orders from customers (facilities you supply)\nPlace orders with your supplying store\n\nQuantify amounts required based on simple or complex formulas\nTrack order status as your supplying store fulfils and ships the order!\nReceive goods into stock when the order arrives\n\n\nBe alerted to low stock levels from the dashboard\nPerform basic dispensing\n\nManage patient records\nCreate a prescription for a patient\n\n\nManage cold chain\n\nView logs from temperature sensors\nUpload data from USB temperature loggers\nBe alerted of temperature excursions and breaches\nConnect temperature monitoring devices to stock via stock locations\n\n\nExtend functionality of the base system with the use of front-end plugins. These allow for custom development of simple tasks such as adding fields to records which can then be displayed in lists and editing forms. For further details, see the plugin readme.\n\nWhat makes mSupply special?🔗\nThere are a lot of systems that manage inventory. Open mSupply has unique features that make it ideal to use for health supply chains in low resource settings:\n\nOffline first: mSupply is designed from the ground up to work without internet. We know from 20 years of experience that even the most reliable internet connections sometimes fail or get overloaded. mSupply allows you to work without having to worry about second-by-second internet quality. Of course, when you need to place orders or receive updates from other facilities, you need internet for a few minutes then.\nScalable: We've designed Open mSupply to handle billions of transactions a year, but to also work on an Android tablet! You can implement mSupply in one facility, knowing that if you later decide to deploy thousands of sites, mSupply will still be the right tool.\n\nTo get some insight into the full breadth of mSupply's functionality, have a look at the legacy mSupply software documentations at https://www.msupply.org.nz - it's almost 1000 pages if you print it all (so maybe don't ☺️)\nTerminology🔗\nThe following table outlines some of the common terms used in mSupply, and also guides users of legacy mSupply regarding terminology improvements we have made.\nOpen mSupply TermLegacy mSupply termDefinition\nOutbound ShipmentCustomer InvoiceThe creation of a supply of goods to a particular customer (facility)\nInbound ShipmentSupplier InvoiceThe receiving of a supply of goods from a particular supplier\nRequisitionCustomer RequisitionsAn order for supply of goods made by a particular customer (facility)\nInternal OrdersSupplier RequisitionsA request for stock made for a particular supplier (facility)\n\nGetting Started🔗\nTo run Open mSupply you will require an mSupply server to operate as a central server. While we are planning to create a new open source central server, that is not yet available.\nNote that we are also currently working through testing the migration process and the integration of Open mSupply with an existing mSupply system. As such, we aren't recommending that you upgrade without talking to us first. \nInstallation🔗\nPreconditions🔗\n\nYou need an existing mSupply system with Legacy mSupply server with web and sync server modules\nAs of December 2023, it is not possible to migrate an existing Legacy (or Mobile) mSupply store to an Open mSupply store; only new stores can be created in Open mSupply\n\nProcedure:🔗\n\nAny Open mSupply stores need to be created in the Legacy mSupply central server as detailed in Creating new stores.

It can run on windows, mac or linux operating systems.\nHardware Requirements🔗\nGeneral hardware recommendations🔗\n\n\nIn environments with regular power outages, it is highly recommended to procure Laptop machines rather than desktop machines. Laptop machines will almost always be the best solution in terms of both cost and effectiveness for these reasons:\n\nIn environments with poor quality electricity supply, laptop computers will generally be more reliable than desktop computers with UPS protection. In such environments UPS batteries will normally die within 2 years. Laptop batteries have better power management and the batteries last longer\nEven when the battery runs out on a laptop, the power management will normally cause the machine to shut down gracefully.\nLaptop computers have built-in microphone and camera for provision of support\nLaptop computers have built-in Wi-Fi adaptor for network connection\nLaptop computers are smaller and lighter than desktop computers, and so are less costly to ship.\n\n\n\nA connected printer is not absolutely necessary in every situation, but for most situations it is a requirement. An ink-jet or laser is preferable.\n\n\nBuy hardware for which good after sales support is available\n\n\nBuy brands with a reputation for quality (even if it means buying a slower/older machine)\n\n\nWindows, Mac, and, Linux hardware requirements🔗\nHardware requirements vary widely depending on what you want to use Open mSupply for. Here's a rough guide:\nMachineTechnical MinimumRecommended\nWindows Client machine for use with server64 bit processorWindows 104 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorWindows 108 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nMac Client machine for use with server64 bit processormacOS Mojave (10.14) – macOS Big Sur (11)(Latest release of major version is required, such as 10.14.6)4 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorMac OS 10.14.6 or later8 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nWindows server64 bit processorWindows 10 Pro or Win server 20198 Gb RAM50 GB HDD/SDD volume with daily backups to an external volume64 bit processorWindows Server 2019+8 Gb RAM4 x HDD/SDD volumes, 3 configured as RAID1 or RAID5 with hot spareDaily backups to the fourth volume plus daily off-site backupsAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\nLinux client or server64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar4 Gb RAM256 Gb storage64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar8 Gb RAM256 Gb storage\nAndroid client or server64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage\n\n\nRecording stock transactions is a core Open mSupply activity. Most stock transaction data is numeric. A numeric keypad is often helpful for machines that have a lot of data entry done on them.\n\nMobile / tablet requirements🔗\nYou are able to use a browser on a tablet to connect to an Open mSupply server, and the only requirement here is a suitably fast tablet with a browser such as chrome or firefox.\nFor a stand-alone, offline, solution a mobile application is also available for android devices.\nRecommended Specifications:\nIn short, Open mSupply mobile runs on Android tablets (not on phones as there is too much data to use well on small phone screens).\nThe application requires at least Android 5.0 (Lollipop)\nMinimumRecommended\nDisplay size9.8 inches10.1 inches\nResolution768 x 1024 pixels800 x 1200 pixels\nAndroid version5.08.1\nProcessorQuad-core 1.3GHz\nMemory1.5 Gb RAM\n\nIn order to provide support, the device must also be compatible with MDM (Mobile Device Management) software and support google services. Please contact mSupply Foundation for details.\nPlease contact us for testing and / or advice before making a large hardware purchase.\nSmart UPS🔗\nA 'smart' UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) detects when the battery power is about to run out and sends a notification to software on the server which triggers a graceful shut down of the computer. To enable this, there needs to be a cable connection (normally USB) between the UPS and the computer combined with software running on the computer.\nIn our experience, the primary cause of computer hardware failure is data corruption due to ungraceful shutdowns. This happens when power to the computer is cut instantly, without any notification to the computer to shut down gracefully. If the machine is 'protected' by a normal UPS, then this can still happen when the battery power runs out. Even if the machine is notionally protected by a 'smart' UPS, there are a number of circumstances where this UPS protection fails:\n\nCable connection and software can fail.\n\nCable becomes disconnected\nSoftware isn't configured correctly\nSoftware doesn't start up\n\n\nUPS batteries degrade (normally within 2 years of installation in environments with regular power cuts) and there is too little capacity to run long enough for the computer to shut down gracefully after receiving the notification from the UPS\n\nLaptop computers tend to be much more resilient to power failure:\n\nA laptop's built-in 'smart' UPS is very reliable\nThe internal batteries last much longer than UPS batteries\nEven if the laptop internal battery degrades, the 'smart' function appears to work much more reliably than a standalone UPS communicating with a 'tower' computer.\n\nHere are some additional advantages of laptops vs. desktop machines:\n\nLower cost of freight:\n\nTo send the machine to site\nTo send spare parts for repair on-site\nTo retrieve the machine from site for any repairs that can not be undertaken on site\n\n\nIt is standard to have features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and camera included by default and this may not be the case with desktops\n\nA concern with laptop computers is security. It is easier to steal a laptop computer from an office than it is to steal a desktop computer. For this reason, laptops are normally configured with a physical locking feature such as Kensington lock slot.\nBecause Open mSupply is dealing with lots of numbers (quantities of stock), it is highly recommended to have a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Smaller laptop computers (14“ screen or less) will not have this. Smaller laptop computers normally have an impractically small screen. It is therefore recommended to procure a laptop computer with a keyboard that includes a numeric keypad - which will necessarily entail a larger screen.\nUseful productivity accessories for laptop computers include\n\nExternal mouse (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal keyboard (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal screen\n\nBandwidth and Latency requirements🔗\nFirstly, this is a good time to mention our synchronisation system, which has saved many countries from a failed installation!\nOffline (Sync) mode🔗\n\n128kbps bandwidth\nhigh latency (e.g. satellite) is OK, and users will not notice it in day-to-day operations, as sync is running in the background, and requests for data a fulfilled from the local database, not over the internet.\nintermittent (say only once a week) is OK\n\nCloud hosted (Online) mode🔗\n\nThe initial download of Javascript code is around 1 Mb, so a 512kbps connection or faster is best (loads in 10 seconds or so)\nYou need an internet connection on to use Open mSupply in this mode.\nhigh latency (e.g. a satellite or overloaded connection) will result in slower performance\n\nBackup system🔗\nOnce you start using Open mSupply, it's important that you have a method of backing up your data. In a default installation, Open mSupply stores all its data in a file that rapidly becomes large. You need, therefore, to have a high capacity removable storage device. We strongly recommend the use of an external hard disk using either firewire (IEEE 1394) or USB2 to facilitate off-site storage of backups.\n\nIf not using our internet backup service, you need to be able to store backed up data off-site to prevent the risk of loss by fire, theft, etc.\n\nAntivirus🔗\nWindows based operating systems are particularly prone to malware if precautions are not taken. We recommend the following precautions:\n\nInstall a reputable anti-virus program, including web protection if the computer has access to the internet\nDisable USB ports - refer to this site for suggested methods\n\nEnsure that access to passwords to allow exceptions to the above two measures are kept secure.\nmSupply🔗\nAn installation of mSupply is currently required when running Open mSupply (this is used to manage a number of centralised aspects of the system). \nThe version of both mSupply and Open mSupply is important, as not all versions of each are compatible with each other. \nThe table below shows which version of mSupply you will require when running Open mSupply:\nOpen mSupplymSupply\n1.1.00 - 1.1.167.04.01+\n1.2.00+7.05.05+\n1.4.00+7.09.00+\n\nIf you attempt to connect to an incompatible server you'll get an error message like this:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/roadmap/":{"body":"This road map will be updated about once every six weeks.\nIt only covers our immediate committed work stream.

We like Firefox, but Chrome and its myriad children will also suffice.\nEnter the web address (URL) of your mSupply server. In our case we're using https://demo-open.msupply.org - our test web site.\nAfter pressing  on your keyboard you'll be shown the login page\n\n\n\nEnter your user name and password and press  on your keyboard, or click the [Log in] button\n\nAll going well, you'll be redirected to the dashboard page.\nIf there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:\n\nTry re-typing the username and password (note that both are case-sensitive).\nWhen you log in, the default store for your user is selected as the current store. If you have access to other stores, you'll be able to change stores after logging in (see below).\nIf you have logged in previously, and changed stores, then the most recent store will be selected for you when you log in.\nNavigating around🔗\nThe main menu is on the left side of the screen. If you have a small screen size, then it will be collapsed by default - for larger screens it will instead be open by default.\nTo open and close you can click on the logo at the top, as shown below. The menu remains either open or closed once you have selected an option.\nIf the menu is closed, simply hovering over the menu items will open it, in which case clicking on an item will let the menu close again. If you are on a tablet, clicking on a menu item will have the same effect.\n\nOn some screens you'll see that the header shows a heading, such as Outbound Shipment in the example above. Clicking on a specific shipment then changes that heading to Outbound Shipment/ #[the shipment number]. You are able to click on the Outbound Shipment part to return to the list - or use the main navigation on the left.\nKeyboard shortcuts🔗\nThere are keyboard shortcuts used throughout Open mSupply. Rather than remember them all, to get started you simply have to remember the combination control (ctrl)+k (windows and linux) or cmd (⌘)+k (mac)\nThis will bring up the following window, no matter which page you are on:\n\nThis shows you the list of globally available shortcuts, for example pressing d on your keyboard will take you to the dashboard (unless you are entering text into an input field!).\nHowever, you can also click on an item in the list, or search available commands:\n\nIn addition - there are various places where specific keyboard shortcuts are available. An example is the tab control used in both Stocktakes and Inbound Shipments. Here you can use control+1 to navigate to the first tab (Quantities) or control+2 for the second tab (Pricing) etc. If you press + on your keyboard, you can add a new batch.\n\nFooter🔗\nThe bottom of the screen contains some useful information and is shown on every screen\n\nSome users have access to more than one store. To change the store which is currently selected, simply click on the store name in the footer:\n\nYou will see the notification and the store name in the footer will be updated. From now, all actions will be in the newly selected store.\nIn a similar way, you can select another language by clicking on the current language in the footer:\n\nHelp!🔗\nIf you get stuck at any time when using the site, click on the Docs menu item.\n\nThis will take you to the documentation page which relates to the current page you are viewing.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/","title":"Inventory"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/images/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/images/","title":"Inventory"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/locations/":{"body":"Keeping track of where stock is in your store is an important part of good warehouse practice. You don't want to have to go hunting through your whole store for stock, wasting time and energy when mSupply can tell you exactly where it is!\nLocations in mSupply are the places you store stock.\nViewing your store's locations🔗\nTo view the storage locations of your store, go to Inventory &gt; Locations in the navigation panel:\n\nYou will see a list of your storage locations:\n\nLooking for a specific location🔗\nYou can filter the list by location name or on hold status.\n\nCreating a new location🔗\nTo create a new location, tap on the New Location button in the top right corner of the screen:\n\nA window like this opens:\n\n\nName: Enter the name of the new location\nCode: Enter a code for the new location\nOn Hold (checkbox): If you check this box, then goods in this location cannot be selected for issue to customers. Goods can be moved in to, and out, of the location but they cannot be issued from that location.\n\n\nPutting a location on hold can be useful if:\n\n- The stock needs to be kept from being issued until some inspection / approval (e.g. quarantine or under bond)\n\n- The stock is a bulk quantity with the same expiry date as another stock line in another location from which you want stock issued. You can use this feature to force mSupply to always suggest issuing stock of this item from the 'issue' location rather than this 'bulk' location. When you have finished issuing stock from the 'issue' location, and you want to issue the stock that is in the 'bulk' location, you will need to either take the 'bulk' location off hold, or, move all, or some of it (split), the stock from the 'bulk' location.\n\nEditing a new location🔗\nTo edit a location, simply tap on one in the location list.\nDeleting a location🔗\nTo delete a location:\n\nCheck the box of the location that you want to delete in the location list\nClick on the Select dropdown menu and select Delete selected line\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/locations/","title":"Locations"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-takes/":{"body":"mSupply will automatically keep track of your stock levels for you, as you receive and distribute it. But sometimes data gets entered incorrectly or stock goes out without anyone making an entry in the system.\nOf course, we try not to let that happen but, if it does happen, we can make corrections. The easiest way to correct mistakes is to do a Stocktake.\nIn mSupply, you can easily do a stocktake for:\n\nA full inventory\nA limited range of items\nA single item\n\nViewing Stocktakes🔗\nTo view your stocktakes, go to Inventory and then Stocktakes in the navigation panel:\n\nThis brings up a list of all your stocktakes:\n\nFor each stock stake you can see:\n\nThe stock take number\nThe stock take status. There are two stock take statuses:\n\nNew: a stocktake you are still working on\nFinalised: a stocktake that has alredy been performed. You can no longer edit it.\n\n\nA description of the stocktake (eg. March Stocktake)\nIf any, a comment about the stoctake\nThe date of the stock take\n\n\nThere is little point in keeping old stocktakes with status = NEW, especially if you are about to create a new stocktake containing the same items. Indeed, it can be quite dangerous to leave old stocktakes with status NEW in your system. If time has passed since the stocktake was created, then the snapshot and actual quantities are almost certainly incorrect. For good housekeeping reasons, it is good practice to delete old NEW stocktakes.\n\nCreating a new stock take🔗\nLet's start a new stocktake. To do so, tap on the New Stocktake button in the right corner of the screen.\n\nA window appears, where you can opt to create a stocktake based on items in a master list, items in a particular location, items that are in stock, or an empty stocktake:\n\nClick on OK when you have selected the option you would like.\nThe stocktake will then be created, and existing stock lines will be used to populate the values for batch, expiry, pack size and snapshot number of packs. The lines show as light blue, and will change to black when a value is entered for the counted quantity.\nYou are not able to edit the pack size of stocktake rows which are linked to an existing stock line. If you wish to repack, you can delete the row and add a new row or rows, as necessary.\n\n\nDon't worry if an item is missing from your newly created stocktake. You will have the possibility to add more items to your stocktake afterwards. \n\nEntering reasons🔗\nIf you have inventory adjustment options configured in your central server, then you are required to enter a reason when the counted number of packs specified does not match the snapshot number of packs.\nFor example, entering 25 for the counted quantity of Paracetamol, will add a red * to the right of the Reason input and show the negative inventory adjustment reasons:\n\nIf you try to save the stocktake row without entering a reason you will see an error:\n\nand the stocktake row that requires a reason to be entered will be highlighted in red as shown below.\n\nPrinting Stocktake sheet🔗\nWhen viewing a specific Stocktake, simply click the Print button which is on the top right of the page.\nWhen printing, a PDF file is generated for you, which will then open in a new browser tab. This can then be printed using your browser by clicking print or using control+P (if using windows) or cmd+P keys on your keyboard (if using a mac).\n\nThis will either\n\nShow a menu of possible reports for you to select from before creating a PDF. This will happen if there are more than one report defined for the Stocktake report type.\nCreate a PDF immediately, if there is only one report to select from\n\n\nFiltering lines🔗\nThe list of stocktake lines can get very long if you have a large stocktake. To make working with the stocktake easier to manage, you can filter the list by item name or code.\nSimply enter some or all of an item code in the filter input:\n\nor, enter some of an item's name:\n\nYou can also group the lines by item by enabling the Group by item switch.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-takes/","title":"Stocktakes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-view/":{"body":"One of the most important - but easiest - tasks in mSupply is to check how much stock you have on hand. When you create an Outbound Shipment and add an item, mSupply will tell you if you have enough stock. But at many other times, you might want to quickly check, and it is very simple to do so.\nViewing stock🔗\nIn the navigation panel, Go to Inventory and tap on the Stock submenu:\n\nA detailed list of your inventory appears:\n\nThe list is divided into 8 columns:\n\nCode: This is the code assigned to this item in mSupply\nName: This is the name by which mSupply will refer to the item\nBatch: Batch number of the stock line\nExpiry: Expiry date of the batch\nLocation: Where the item is being stored in your facility\nUnit: The unit you use for this item\nPack Size: Number of units per pack\nPack Qty: Number of packs available in your store\nSOH: The total quantity of stock on hand, in number of packs\nSupplier Shows the source of this stock item\n\nExporting Stock🔗\nThe list of Stock can be exported to a comma separated file (csv). Simply click the export button (on the right, at the top of the page)\n\nand the file will be downloaded. The export function will download all Stock lines, not just the current page, if you have more than 20 of them.\nLooking for a specific item🔗\nYou can filter the list by item name or code, location or by expiry. This can be useful if you're looking for one particular item.\n\nClick on the Filters to show the available filters, select an option, for example Code or Name, and type as much of an item name or code in the Enter item code or name field:\n\nEditing a stock line🔗\nClicking on a line in the list will open the edit screen. Here, you can change the properties of this stock line.\n\nTo see changes made to this stock line, you can click the Log tab. Note that you might have to scroll to the right in order to see all of the details!\n\nLog, showing changes made to this item\n\nWith the log scrolled to the right\nUpdating barcode🔗\nThis feature is available when running either the android or desktop versions of Open mSupply.\nThere is an additional button shown when editing a stock line:\n\nClicking this will start the barcode scanner - if one is attached, when running desktop. If running on android, the camera on the device is used.\nIf a barcode is scanned successfully, then the barcode field is populated with the scanned value. If a QR code which has a batch and expiry information is scanned, then these fields on the stock edit window are also populated from the scanned code.\nYou can also press the 'control (ctrl)' and 's' keys at the same time to start the barcode scanner\nOnce you have updated the barcode, this code is associated with the item, for this particular pack size. This item will now be automatically detected when adding items to an Outbound Shipment using a barcode scanner.\nBarcodes updated in this way will also synchronised with other stores, which means that codes you scan here will allow other stores to automatically add these items to Outbound Shipments using a barcode scanner.\nRepacking stock🔗\nThe repack feature gives us the ability to break down stock into smaller pack sizes, consolidate it into larger pack sizes or move part or all of a stock line to a new location. Here's how to use it:\nIn the list showing all current stock, there is a column on the far left, titled Repack. To repack a stock item, click the repack icon for that line, like so:\n\nTo begin with, the stock line won't have any repacks showing, so you'll see a window like this:\n\nClick the New button to start a repack:\n\nFrom here, you can enter the number of packs which you'd like to repack, up to a maximum of the current number of packs in stock.

If none of them look correct, or if no results are returned, you'll want to create a new patient record.\nClicking the Create button will create the new patient record, and you'll see a new screen, showing the patient details:\n\nPatient List\nNavigating to the Dispensary → Patients menu item will show a list of existing patients.\n\nSearching for a Patient\nIn the list view, filters are available, above the patient list that can be used to narrow and specify the search. You can filter the list by:\n\nFirst name (enabled by default)\nLast name (enabled by default)\nlast name  (enabled by default)\nPatient ID\nDate of Birth\nGender\n\nThis can be useful to quickly find patients with common names or if there is a large number of existing patients.\n\nPatient Details View\nSelecting a patient from the patient list will open the patient details view.\n\nThe information recorded here is customisable for a specific installation of Open mSupply. While there's a base set of data recorded, such as name and birth date, there is also a range of types of data which can be configured in addition to this. Your patient detail view will likely look slightly different to that shown above.\nOn the patient detail view there are three tabs:\n\nDetails: shows the general patient information\nPrograms: shows a list of program enrolments for the selected patient\nEncounters: shows a list of encounters for the selected patient\n\nTo view the list of programs which this patient is enrolled in, click the Programs tab.\n\nIn this list you can click on a specific program to edit details of the program enrolment, as shown below:\n\nThe Encounters tab behaves in the same way.

Examples of programs are HIV Testing &amp; Counselling, HIV Care &amp; Treatment, TB &amp; Malaria programs. For each program you can have defined any number of fields which are entered when registering patients, containing information in defined formats, such as dates, text, drop down lists and the like.\nPatient Program Enrolment\nTo enrol a patient into a program select the Add Program button in the top right corner of the patient details view.\n\nThis will open a dialog window with a list of available patient programs.\nPrograms which the patient is already enrolled in are greyed out and can’t be selected.\n\nTo enrol a patient into a program select the desired program from the list.\nThis opens the program enrolment document where program specific information can be entered.\nNote, the content of the program enrolment document is program specific and can be configured by the site administrator.\nEncounters\nAn 'Encounter' is the recorded visit of a patient, and their treatment, under a specific program.\nTo view the list of encounters, navigate to the Encounters item under the Dispensary menu:\n\nClicking on this will bring up a list of encounters that have been recorded, and shows details about the encounter as you can see below:\n\nPatient Program Encounters\nOnce a patient is enrolled in a program, an encounter for this program can be created.\nLike programs, encounters are highly customisable and are tailored to a specific situation. The encounter has some basic information, such as date &amp; time of the encounter, status and clinician; and a range of fields of information, divided into sections. These can be as simple or complex as you like.\nTo create an encounter, select Add Encounter through the drop-down menu in the right top corner.\nA patient must be enrolled in a program to input an encounter\n\nThis will open a dialog window to create an encounter.\nFirst, the program enrolment associated with the encounter must be selected.\nSecondly, the encounter date must be selected. The encounter date can be in the past (for entering a finished encounter), or in the future (to schedule an encounter - AKA make an appointment).\n\nOnce an encounter is created, the full encounter document will open to allow encounter details to be entered.\nThe content of the encounter document is program specific and can be configured by the system administrator\nEvery encounter has an encounter header where common encounter details can be updated, e.g. the clinician who handles the encounter or the encounter status.\nThe list of clinicians is managed by the site administrator and must be updated on the mSupply central server\nAn encounter can have three statuses:\n\nPending (this status can be displayed as scheduled or missed depdning on the current date)\nVisited\nCancelled\n\n\nThe More button in the right top of the encounter detail view opens a column with additional encounter information such as a summary of previous encounters and the option to add an encounter note.\n\nYou can easily view patient details while looking at an encounter. Simply click on the patient name at the top of the encounter header, as shown:\n\nExport Patient List\nThe list of patients can be exported to a comma separated file. This will export the following patient details:\n\nID\nNational ID\nFirst name\nLast name\nDate of Birth\n\nThis can be done by clicking on the Export button in the top right corner of the patient list view.\n\nReports\nNavigating to Dispensary &gt; Reports will show you a list of reports that have been configured for your system.\n\nYou can click on the Print button beside a report to print it.

Once sent, no further changes can be made to finalised orders. \n\nApproving Internal Orders🔗\nRemote approval process🔗\nIt is possible to configure stores, so that requisitions require approval from specified users before they can be fulfilled.\nFor a full description of this process refer to the mSupply Remote Authorisation documentation.\nTo do this:\n\nIn the requesting store, enable the store preference Include requisitions from this store in supplier's remote authorisation process\nIn the supplying store, enable the store preference Use remote authorisation for response requisitions\n\nFor further detail on configuring store preferences, refer to the mSupply documentation on the topic.\nWhen configured in this way, the requesting store will see an additional column in the Internal Order list, showing the approval status:\n\nAnd when viewing a specific Internal Order, there are columns showing the approved quantity, approved number of packs and a comment entered by the approver, if there is one:\n\nSimilarly, the supplying store will have an additional column in the requisition list view showing the approval status :\n\nAnd finally, a specific requisition will also have new columns, for the approved quantity and an approval comment, if one has been entered by the approver:\n\nLocal approval process🔗\nAnother option for implementing an approval step for Internal Orders is to enable what is called 'local approval'. With this, you can allow only certain users to change the status of an Internal Order to Sent. To allow a user to change the status of an Internal Order to Sent, they require the permission Can confirm Internal Order as Sent to be enabled.\nTo set the permission, edit the user within mSupply and change to the Open mSupply permissions tab, shown below:\n\nWithout this option checked, the user will not be able to update the Internal Order status to Sent and the order is unable to be processed.\nOn changing the status to Sent, the user's details are added to the comment field; this can be seen when viewing the Internal Order, in the details panel:\n\nand is also shown to the approver in the remote authorisation web application if that is being used.\nThe additional text is of the form:\nApproved by [user's full name]. Email: [user's email address] and Phone Number: [user's phone number].\nThese details are taken from the user, as configured in mSupply.

A requisition with this status cannot be edited and you cannot create Outbound Shipments from it.\nAuthorised: all lines that were waiting for authorisation have been authorised (with or without adjustments). The comments and quantity to supply can be edited and Outbound Shipments can be created from requisitions that are authorised.\nDenied: the authoriser has reviewed the requisition and the lines have all been denied.

Open tendering via HSH is currently under development.\nEven after this feature is developed purchasers may choose to issue restricted tenders.\nYour Responsibilities🔗\nYou must ensure that you have engaged with the relevant Purchaser so that they know you have an interest in supplying for them. Not all procurements are openly advertised.\nEach Purchaser may have different requirements for new suppliers to be invited to their supply requests.

This differs from normal dispensing in several important ways:\n\n\nPatient registration collects a lot more data than what is typically required for dispensing a prescription, such as:\n\nHas the patient ever had Covid-19 before?\nIs the patient pregnant?\nIs the patient lactating?\nHas the patient ever had an adverse reaction to a vaccine previously?\n\n\n\nThe dispensing workflow is greatly simplified:\n\nWhen an existing patient is chosen, the extra information fields are chosen, as many of them are time-dependent, so the current value for the field might be different from the saved value. For instance, the patient might not have been pregnant when they were recorded in the system some weeks or months ago, but they are now\nOnly items marked as vaccines are shown, so there is no need to type in the item name- you simply choose from the list\nThe dispensed quantity is always one, so no quantity field needs filling out\nThe vaccine batch and VVM status are shown, and the batch used can be selected\nIf using multi-dose vials, the batch with an open vial is chosen by default\nYou can record that the patient refused vaccination\nYou can record who the vaccinator was\n\n\n\nAdverse Reaction Reporting is added to the system:\n\nThe adverse reaction reporting data that is collected is configurable on the server, so can vary depending on the vaccination campaign being run at the time. Further documentation is available here.\n\n\n\nSetup\nSetup is technical and needs to be done carefully. We know you're careful ;-)\nHere are the instructions.\nUsing the module\nOnce Setup is complete, you'll end up with an mobile navigation screen that looks like this:\n\nStep one: Patient details\nNote that each step has a Cancel button which will cancel the process\nYou can also press on any one of the three steps along the top of the window  after they’ve been completed to revisit that step and edit details if needed.\n\nSelecting a patient\n\n\nSearch by last name, first name and Date of birth\n\nIn the example below, we've entered the first and last name exactly, and the date of birth. Amazingly, there is only one match!\n\n\n\nWhen typing, we look up in your local database first. If the patient still doesn’t come up, click the Search online button, which will use the same search information you have already entered and send a request to your cloud server to see if the patient exists anywhere in your system.\n\nNOTE: Requires the internet\nIf you still can’t find the patient, click “New Patient”\nIf you do find your patient, click on the row to go to step 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively (as of v8.1.0), it is possible to lookup patients by QR Code (provided these details have been loaded into mSupply). \n\nUpon tapping the Scan QR Code button a window will appear with a camera view\nAs soon as a QR Code is found in the viewfinder mSupply mobile will attempt to first search in your local database for a patient that matches the QR Code scanned\nIf the patient was not found locally and there is internet available, a search will then be sent to your cloud server to see if the patient exists anywhere in your system\nIf the patient was still not found after a search on the cloud server (or internet is not available), you will get a message indicating that no patient was found, and will arrive back at the manual entry page, where you can either enter details manually (as per above) or try another QR Code.\n\n\n\n\nStep two: Add or edit patient information\nAfter choosing a patient, you're shown the standard mSupply information for the patient in the left-hand panel, and any extra information that you have configured in the right-hand panel.\n\nStep three: Additional vaccination details\nNote that this third step is only available from mobile v8.1.0 onwards, and requires a form to be configured on the mSupply server for it to display. The form configuration drives the content shown in step three.\n\nIf using v8.0.X, or a form is not configured on the server, there will only be three steps total shown in the vaccine dispensing flow (step three will instead be dispense a vaccine. \nStep four: Dispense a vaccine\n\nHere you can select who the vaccinator is - these will be set up on your primary server\nYou can also select which vaccine you are giving to the patient. The one which was dispensed most recently will be auto-selected for you\nYou can also select which batch the patient received.

Read how here.\nPermissions and Services\nThe vaccine module requires additional permissions and services to be enabled on your mobile device. \nWhen all permissions and services required for Mobile ColdChain are enabled, the 'cog icon' will be in the mSupply Mobile title line (top right of your mobile screen):\n\nHowever, if some required permissions and services are disabled, the 'hazard icon' will be in the mSupply Mobile title line:\n\nIf your title line shows that some permissions and services are disabled, press on the 'hazard icon' to open the Permissions and Services window.\nAny permission or service that is disabled will be indicated with a 'cross icon' as below:\n\nTo enable, simply press on the cross icon next to the permission or service.  Your device will prompt you to enable the permission or service.\n\nPress Allow.\nOnce all of the permissions and services have been enabled, your window will look like this:\n\nApproved mSupply Temperature Sensors\nThe following is a list of approved temperature sensors that will work together with mSupply Cold Chain and mSupply Mobile: \n*Blue Maestro Tempo Disc™ Waterproof IP67 Bluetooth Temperature Sensor Beacon and Logger Download PDF.\nApproved sensors can be purchased directly from the manufacturer or reseller online.  Please contact coldchain@msupply.foundation for further information.\nThese sensors have been approved by the World Health Organisation as a temperature monitoring device suitable for use in immunization programmes.\nAdding Sensors\nThe first time you use the Vaccine module, there will be no sensors connected to your device.\n\nTap Add Sensor to start the three-step process to add a sensor.\nPlease make sure that you have an approved mSupply temperature sensor.  Only approved sensors can be connected to mSupply Mobile. \nWe recommend you keep the sensor close when you are adding or editing it within mSupply Mobile.  Also, allow for up to a minute for any changes to be communicated via Bluetooth. \nIf you are using a brand new sensor, press the top of the sensor until it flashes to turn it on.\nStep 1: Select the correct sensor\nWhen you tap Add Sensor, your device will scan and list any sensors that can be connected by Bluetooth.\n\nIf you tap the BLINK button, the LED light for that sensor will flash.  You can use this to make sure that you are connecting the correct sensor. \nWhen you are sure that you have the correct sensor, tap Connect for that sensor.\nStep 2: Sensor Thresholds\nFirstly, some definitions:\n\nConsecutive means a single event where the temperature stays over (or under) the threshold for the whole time. So if you have a threshold of 8 degrees, and a consecutive breach time of 10 minutes, then a breach that lasts for 6 minutes, then drops under the threshold for 2 minutes, then breaches again for 6 minutes is not a consecutive breach, but the 2 x 6 minute breaches are added to the cumulative breach records.\nCumulative means adding together the total time over a certain temperature for a series of breaches.\n\nNow we can set the temperature breach conditions for the sensor.  There are four thresholds that you can define:\n\n\nHot Consecutive\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature above this value for longer than the specified time. Using the +/- buttons, select the maximum temperature and minimum duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nCold Consecutive\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature below this value for longer than the specified time. Using the +/- buttons, select the minimum temperature and minimum duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nHot Cumulative\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature above this value for longer than the total specified time (total time is calculated as the sum of all breach times). Using the +/- buttons, select the maximum temperature and minimum total duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nCold Cumulative\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature below this value for longer than the total specified time specified (total time is calculated as the sum of all breach times). Using the +/- buttons, select the minimum temperature and minimum total duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to long press the +/- buttons to change the values faster.\n\nTap Back if you wish to return to Step 1 and check that you have the correct sensor.\nTap Next to move to Step 3.\nTap Cancel if you no longer want to add the sensor.\nStep 3: Sensor connection\nIn this final step you need to enter:\nSensor Name: Enter a new name for the sensor. This is the name which will appear within mSupply mobile. You should choose a name to make it easy to identify the sensor.\nSensor Code: Enter a short name code for the sensor. You should choose a code that is unique for each sensor.\n\nFor reporting purposes, we recommend that you do not use special characters such as “-, +, *” etc in either the Sensor Name or Sensor Code fields. \n\nLogging Interval: using the +/- buttons, select the length of time between temperature logs.  You can set the logging interval to any length between 1 and 30 minutes. The default logging interval is 5 minutes.\nStart Logging: Use the +/- buttons to select the delay in minutes from now of the first temperature log. The sensor can be configured to start a maximum of 30 days from the current date.\nWhen setting the schedule for the first temperature log, allow sufficient time for the sensor to be placed in its desired location and adjust to the location’s temperature. 20 minutes should be sufficient in most situations.\n\nTap Connect to complete sensor setup and add the sensor to mSupply mobile.  This will return you to the mSupply mobile vaccine home screen and you will see the sensor has been added.\nTap Back if you wish to return to Step 2 and edit the sensor thresholds (temperature breach conditions).\nTap Cancel if you no longer want to add the sensor.\n\nWe recommend that each device should be linked to a maximum of six sensors. Each sensor should only be linked to one device. \n\nEdit Sensor\nTo edit sensor details, you can tap on the ‘’cog’’ icon on the mSupply Vaccine home page (screenshot below) or on the Sensor Detail screen.\n\nAll sensor threshold and sensor connection details are editable except for the start Logging date and time.  Simply tap on the field that you wish to end and make changes.\n\nNo changes will be made until you tap Save.\n\nDepending on your proximity to the sensor and the Bluetooth capabilities of your device, changes can take a few minutes.\n\nPausing Sensor Downloads\nThe edit screen also allows you to Pause temperature logging by the sensor.  When a sensor has been paused, it will appear in the title line both on the mSupply mobile vaccine home screen as well as the Sensor Detail screen.\n\nReplacing a Sensor\nTapping Replace will open up the scanner and allow you to choose from list of alternative sensors.  The list will only show sensors that are not currently connected to your device.\n\nFrom the list, select the replacement sensor.  You can press Blink to check that you have the correct sensor (the LED light will flash for this sensor).\nDeleting a Sensor\nTap Remove to remove any sensor no longer being used. You will receive a prompt to confirm the deletion.\n\nUsing the Vaccine module\nEnabling the Vaccine module will change the look of your menu page, adding an extra Vaccines button. \n\nSupplier Invoices\nWith vaccine module enabled you automatically get a few extra columns on a supplier invoice for vaccines - the Location and Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM) status columns.\n\nYou can select a location by tapping on the arrow icon in the Location cell. This will allow you to choose a location from a list. \n\nYou can also change the Vaccine vial monitor status for items that have been defined as vaccines on the cloud server - this defaults to the lowest level, but can be edited by clicking on the arrow icon in the VVM Status column.\n\nCustomer Invoices\nVaccine module automatically adds two extra columns on a customer invoice - the Doses and Breach columns. \n\n\n\nThe Doses column is for the number of doses actually used (so we can account for open-vial wastage). It will automatically get populated by the item quantity and the number of doses in a vial. This is for convenience, but you can also edit it! There is a maximum limit of the number of doses in a vial for that vaccine and for the item quantity, though.\n\n\nThe Breach column shows when a vaccine item has been in a temperature breach. \n\n\n\n  Without entering a quantity into the customer invoice for the item, we don’t know exactly what batches are being issued, so the breach icon may not show up yet.\n  \n\nIf the breach icon (an orange triangle with an exclamation) does show for a row, this signals that the stock line has had a temperature breach. Tapping the icon will bring up a graph of the temperature breach. In the example below, the fridge seems to be broken, probably not a good idea to use this batch!\n\n\nSupplier Requisitions\nTapping on a row in your supplier requisition will show you the date of the last requisition for your vaccine, as well as other details such as the open and closed vial wastage since the last requisition. \n\nStocktakes\nTapping on a stocktake row for a vaccine item will also show the additional columns for Doses and Breach. \n\nHere, you can adjust the quantities of your vaccine if needed, change the location, or if the vaccine vial monitor status has changed, you can update that here. You can also view the breaches the batch has been in to help you make decisions!\nVaccine home page\nTapping on the Vaccines button in the menu page will bring you to a list of all the temperature sensors connected to your device and an overview of current status and actions for each sensor.\n\nThe sensor header displays the following information:\nCircle: a green circle indicates that the sensor is currently within the specified temperature range and the sensor battery is equal or above 25%. A red circle indicates that the sensor is currently outsides the specified temperature range or the sensor battery is below 25%.\nSensor Name:  as configured during sensor connection.\nWiFi Icon and last log time: the time of the last temperature download occurred.  The time will flash when download is currently in process.\nBattery Icon: a percentage figure and icon showing remaining battery charge for the sensor.\nDown Arrow Icon: Tap to export sensor data (temperature logs and breaches) to csv format and send via email data.\nLight Bulb Icon: Tap to make the sensor LED light flash/blink.\nCog Button: Tap if you wish to edit the sensor configuration.\nThe row under the sensor header displays the following information:\n\n\nSensor’s MAC address\n\n\nThermometer icon and last recorded temperature\n\n\nClock Icon and the time of the last temperature breach (if applicable)\n\n\nTap anywhere on a sensor box to view further details.\nSensor Detail\nTap on the date range on the top left of the screen to change the time (and data) displayed.\n\nThe header information is as above.\nTemperature Graph\nThe red line represents the hot consecutive threshold.  The blue line represents the cold consecutive threshold. (You can set these here).  Any temperature logs outside of the lines (breaches) will be indicated with the exclamation icon.\nThe last temperature logged will display to the right of the graph.  The sensor status rectangle (surrounding the last temperature log) will be:\n\n\nRed for a hot breach.\n\n\nBlue for a cold breach.\n\n\nTemperature Cards\nUnderneath the graph are five temperature cards:\n\nCold Cumulative Breach: the length of the breach \nCold Consecutive Breach: the number of breaches\nAverage temperature: calculated over the date range selected in degrees Centigrade\nHot Cumulative Breach: the length of the breach\nHot Consecutive Breach: the number of breaches\n\nExporting Sensor Data\nIt is possible to download the temperature (breach) logs and sensor settings by clicking the ‘Download’ button in the header (on either the Vaccine home page or the Sensor Details page).\n\nThe Download screen requires:\n\nEmail address\nComment\n\nTapping Download will open a new email in your device’s email application.  The receiver address and comment will be prepopulated, and the sensor data (in CSV format) attached, ready to send.\n\n\nIf you change your mind about emailing the data, tap anywhere in the grayed-out area.\n ","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/vaccine/","title":"Vaccines"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/web-apps/":{"body":"Both the patient registration and adverse reaction monitoring features in mSupply mobile are also available via a web site.\nPatient registrations entered on the web site is immediately available to all sites using the patient lookup feature of mSupply mobile.\nThe front page looks like this:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/web-apps/","title":"Vaccines/ADR Web Portal "},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/","title":"mSupply mobile"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/getting-started/":{"body":"Android device hardware requirements🔗\nGoogle Mobile Services (GMS)🔗\n\nThere is a good chance that if your proposed device is not on this list of supported models, then it will not support Google Mobile Services (GMS), mSupply Mobile and/or the mobile device management software used to remotely manage the device.\nEven if it is on this list, please make sure the model has been validated by Sustainable Solutions before procuring any significant quantities of the device.

It may be worth procuring devices that are mobile data enabled (3G minimum), at least to allow future flexibility. But that doesn't answer the harder questions:\n\nWho is responsible for keeping the device connected?\nWho pays for it?\nWhat happens when the bill isn't paid?\nWhat happens when a generous data cap is exceeded and the internet connection is down? (Somebody may have removed the SIM from the device and placed it in another device…)\n\n\nMost officers in charge of an mSupply Mobile device are capable of keeping their personal cellular mobile device connected to the internet, at least occasionally, which is all that mSupply Mobile needs.  An officer could be happy to receive a nominal monthly fee to [tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) the mSupply Mobile device to their personal cellular device hotspot and data.  This fee might only be payable if the officer meets certain pre-agreed KPIs such as:\n\n\nEnsuring device has connecting to the internet at least, say, once per week,\nConducting stocktakes\nPlacing Internal Orders\nProcessing supplier invoices\nOther(s)\n\nOf course, such an arrangement would still require management.\nConfiguration on the mSupply Server🔗\nBefore using mSupply Mobile, the mSupply central server needs to be configured for it - refer to the mSupply User Guide for details.\n\nIf you are upgrading an existing mSupply Mobile device to version 2.0.0, there are a few changes that need to be made to your mSupply Desktop/Server:\n\nUpgrade to mSupply Server v3.83 or higher\nSet Visibility for Supplying Stores (including main Supplying Store)\nAdd a new Supplier as facility (External Supplier) and make it visible in mobile store\nSet all other mobile/desktop stores that current mobile store needs to interact with (send/receive Requisition, send/receive Invoices) as 'transfers' in store/synchroniser (this needs to be done by your mSupply team)\n\n\nInstallation🔗\nYou can download the latest version of mSupply Mobile from GitHub here.\nConnecting to the central server🔗\nAfter mSupply Mobile is installed on your tablet and you've started it, you need to enter the 'site' credentials (user name and password) and the URL for the mSupply server that will hold the data will be generated by the tablet.\n\nBe careful to enter the correct credentials here. If you fail to enter it three times in a row, you will be locked out from trying again for 1 hour!\nAndroid auto-correct may try to add a space after each word. This will result in incorrect credentials being entered.\n\nLogging in🔗\nAfter the device has synced to the central server you will see the login screen:\n\nSelecting the language🔗\n\nThe first thing to do is to choose your preferred language by clicking Language at the bottom left of the screen. For example, if your first language is Tetum, then you're in luck! - see below.\n\n\nLogging in the user🔗\n\nUsers need to be configured on the mSupply central server - refer to Setting up the Users to access the store\n\nOnce you have selected the language of your choice, enter the credentials (user name and password) for the store user and tap\nLogin\n\n\nBe careful to enter the correct credentials here. If you fail to enter it three times in a row, you will be locked out from trying again for 1 hour!\nAndroid auto-correct may try to add a space after each word. This will result in incorrect credentials being entered.\n\nAfter 3 minutes of not using the app (either it is in the background, or the app is asleep), you will be logged out.\nMain screen🔗\nThis brings us to the main screen. We will be returning to the main screen a lot as we use mSupply Mobile, so it's important to understand the main functions. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nIcon badges🔗\nIcon badges (orange circle with a number) indicate there are unfinalised transactions requiring attention. Click a badge for a description. Badges will automatically disappear when there are no unfinalised transactions remaining.\n\nSync🔗\n\nmSupply Mobile will attempt to sync to the Primary server at regular intervals.\nThe default sync interval is 10 minutes.\nThe interval between these attempts (the sync interval) can be configured to be from 1 minute to 10 minutes by Editing the Sync Interval.\n\nA link on the top right of the screen shows the Sync Status.\n\nClicking this link will take you to a page where you can choose to do a manual sync if you want to re-sync in-between the automatic syncs.\n\nYou can close this page by clicking the cross on the top right.\nSettings🔗\nUsers with the appropriate permissions can access the mobile Settings on the bottom right of the screen.\n\nLogging out🔗\nTo log out, click the Log Out button on the bottom left of the screen.\n\nCustomers🔗\nThe Customers area is for all the stock that goes OUT of your facility. Customers can be other facilities you supply, doctors and nurses doing outreach tours, or individual patients.\nThe Customer Invoices button shows a list of orders sent TO your customers and allows you to create new ones.\nThe Customer Requisitions button shows a list of orders placed BY customers requesting stock from your store.\nSuppliers🔗\nThe Suppliers area shows orders that you have placed and received for your own stock. Usually, you will only have ONE supplier (a medical store or other healthcare facility) and this will be pre-programmed for you.\nThe Supplier Invoices button shows a list of orders you have received or are waiting to receive.\nThe Supplier Requisitions button allows you to place an order and shows a list of orders you have already placed.\nStock🔗\nThe Stock section is used to manage the stock in your store.\nThe Current Stock button allows you to easily see how much stock you have on hand (\"How many paracetamol tablets do I have?\"), search for an individual item, or check expiry dates.\nThe Stocktakes button allows you to do a stocktake on all items or a small selection of items and shows you a list of all previous stocktakes.

As such ALL operating system (i.e. Android) user accounts set up on the device must be for the site, not a person. This way, if a person leaves and another person takes over operation of the device, nothing should need to be changed.\n\n\nEach device running mSupply Mobile will correspond to one mSupply Store.\n\n\n\nInitialising the store🔗\nAfter installing the mSupply Mobile app, you must initialise the data for the mSupply Store that the device is going to be used in. Most of the work is actually done by mSupply but you will need to set the store credentials on the device.\nWhen first syncing the new device the amount of records to sync may be large (say around 50,000). This could take hours to sync, especially over a poor internet connection. For this reason it is possible for you to limit how many months of transactions and stocktakes you want to include. Limiting the sync date range below explains how to limit the sync date range if this is required.\nWhen you Open mSupply Mobile, the first screen looks as follows:\n\n\nPRIMARY SERVER URL: Please enter the correct URL for your mSupply Server, this uses HTTPS protocol for security. For example: https://your-organisation.msupply.org\nSYNC SITE NAME: The site name as configured on the primary server.\nSYNC SITE PASSWORD: The password for the sync site as configured on the primary server.\n\nOnce you have entered the information, click Connect to start sync.\n\nInitialisation can take between 1 and 15 minutes depending on the number of records on the server related to the site being synced.\n\nOnce the server has found all the records to sync, mSupply Mobile will start pulling them between 20 and 500 records at a time depending on the connection speed. If the connection is lost or you close the app, you can resume sync where it stopped by entering the exact same details. Please note that if you enter different details, it will restart the sync completely!\nLogging in to the store🔗\nOnce complete, you will be taken to the login screen.

These are supplier requisitions that you have not yet sent off to your supplying store. You can tap on any In Progress requisitions to open and continue work.\n\nIn Progress Supplier Requisitions in mSupply Mobile are the same as mSupply Desktop Internal Orders with status = sg.\n\n\nThe orange badge above Supplier Requisitions on the home page tells you if there are any unfinalised supplier requisitions - in the screenshots above, you can see that there is one unfinalised supplier requisition.\n\nPast Supplier Requisitions🔗\nTo view past Supplier Requisitions, tap the Past tab.\n\nThe list of past requisitions will all have a Status of Finalised. You can tap on any row to view a finalised requisition. However, no further changes can be made to finalised requisitions.\n\nFinalised Supplier Requisitions in mSupply Mobile are the same as mSupply Desktop Internal Orders with status = fn.\n\nNew Supplier Requisition🔗\nIf you wish to create a new requisition, tap on New Requisition.\n\nAdding items to a Supplier Requisition🔗\nSmall Orders🔗\nIf you only have a few items, tap New Item. This is the best option for small orders.\n\nStart typing to search for the item.\n\nIn this case, we need to purchase Ibuprofen 200mg tablets so we select this item.\n\nWhen you select an item, it will be added to the requisition. The following information is provided about the item:\n\nItem Code and Item Name: as per your mSupply item list details\nCurrent Stock: how much stock currently available in your facility\nMonthly Use: how much stock your facility uses each month on average (based on a configurable number of months (refer Store Preferences tab, but defaults to 3).\nSuggested Quantity: how much stock mSupply Mobile suggests that you order. This is calculated as:\n\nMonthly Use x Max MOS - Current Stock\nSo, for the above example for Ibuprofen 200mg tablets, Suggested Quantity = (453 x 2) - 80 = 827\n\n\n\n\nWhat should Max MOS be set to?\nMax MOS = Lead time + Order cycle + Buffer stock\n\nLead time: The time between creating the requisition and receiving the stock. For most facilities using mSupply Mobile, we can hope that this will be no more than 1 month\nOrder cycle: This is the frequency of ordering. If it is every month, this will be 1, if it is once per quarter, then this will be 3.\nBuffer stock: This is the safety margin of stock that the facility plans for. The safety margin accounts for things such as an order being missed, or delivery delayed. A common approach is to set this to twice the Order cycle.\n\nSo, if we have:\n\nLead time = 1\nOrder cycle = 1\nBuffer stock = 2 x 1 = 2\n\nThen:\n\n\nMax MOS = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\n\n\nRequested Quantity: This is set to zero by default. You can do either of the following:\n\nAccept the Suggested Quantities by tapping on the Use Suggested Quantities button. This populates all cells.\nChange the values manually by tapping in the cell and changing the number. You can also do this after accepting the Suggested Quantities by tapping on the Use Suggested Quantities button.\n\n\n\nLarger Orders🔗\nIf you have a lot of items to order (for example, when you are placing your main order), it can be slow to add them one by one.\nTo add a lot of items at once, tap Add Master List Items.\n\nSelect one or more master lists by tapping on the check box next to the master list (the row will turn orange once selected). Only master lists visible to your store are shown. In this example, there is only one master list available. Once you have made your selection, tap Done.\n\nThe items on the selected master list(s) will then automatically appear in the supplier requisition.\n\nThe columns are the same as above for adding New Item.\nUse Suggested Quantities🔗\nIf you tap Use Suggested Quantities on the requisition header, mSupply Mobile will automatically copy the values in the Suggested Quantity column into the Requested Quantity column.\n\n\nPlease note, when you tap **Use Suggested Quantities**, this will overwrite any value that had previously been entered in the **Requested Quantity** column.  However, you can still manually overwrite the amount of stock requested for each item afterward.\n\nCreate Automatic Order🔗\nIf you tap Create Automatic Order on the requisition header, mSupply Mobile will automatically create a supplier requisition with all items stocked at your facility (from all Master Lists) that require stock. That is, any item at your facility that has a suggested quantity greater than zero will be listed. The Requested Quantity column will also be filled with the suggested quantity value.\n\nOnce again, you can still check the amount of stock requested for each item and change if required.\nFinalising a Supplier Requisition🔗\nTap the Finalise button, then Confirm and your order will go to the supply store.\n\nEven if you don't have a current internet connection, it's ok! The order will send automatically once your device is able to connect to the internet.\n\nRemember:\nA Supplier Requisition is an order that you have placed with your supplier.\nA Supplier Invoice is a record of what your supplier has actually sent you.\nThese are not always the same, as your supplier might not have enough stock to fill your requisition, or they might have sent you some extra stock. When stock arrives at your facility, you should check it off against the Supplier Invoice.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/order_and_receive/supplier-requisitions/","title":"Supplier Requisitions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/","title":"Settings and Set-up"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/config/":{"body":"Making items visible in the new store using Master List(s)🔗\n\nClick on the Master Lists tab and select at least one Master List.

The mSupply central server generates reports on a schedule, and those reports that have been correctly configured for Mobile dashboards will be generated for mobile sites.  These reports will be synced to mobile store tablets when they connect to the central server.\n\nOnce a report is configured to be sent to mSupply Mobile sites, it will be sent to every mSupply Mobile site that has the Dashboard store preference turned on. \n\n\n\nRemember reports configured to be sent to mSupply Mobile sites will NOT be sent to the legacy (non-grafana) mSupply web dashboard.\n\n\nDashboard reports need the following properties added to them in order for them to show in the mSupply mobile stores.\nPropertyValuesDescription\nisMobileTrue or FalseThis is the important one!  This enables or disables sending this report to mobile sites. When isMobile is True, Mobile dashboard reports are generated, and no legacy (non-grafana) mSupply web dashboard report is generated.

If the reportType parameter is not set, it defaults to Table.\n#[report property][field on store table]This allows you to pick a value from the store table, which is therefore store specific, and assign the value to the report property. In this way you can create a report which is customised to each store. The report property must exist in your report for this to work.  See report options for available reports and properties.  See example below\n\n\nInternal code logic description🔗\n\n\nIntroduces new table dashboard_store_report\n\n\nThe code checks for isMobile parameter, if present it will look for parameters with # prefix\n\n\nThe code goes through each mobile site's store record, it will specifically look for the fields represented by # prefixed parameter's value\n\n\nThe code will then take the value of the store field \n\neg. \n\nif #store_name = \"name\"\nthen we look for [store]name of each mobile site's store\nIf [store]name = \"ABC\" we insert store_name = \"ABC\" in the dashboard method\nRepeat for next store\n\n\n\n\n\nA unique report is generated for the store specific dashboard.\n\n\nWe store this report data in dashboard_report table in the database, since that's how the legacy web dashboard does it.\n\n\nWhen the report has been stored in the database, we take that value and create the store specific record with the data in dashboard_store_report. Then we go off to the next store's report generation.\n\n\nIf there are 17 mobile stores, there will be 17 records for each mobile dashboard report with each record representing each store's dashboard data.\n\n\nOnly the store specific record from dashboard_store_report will be synced to the particular store.

Code and developer docs are available on GitHub.\nIf you are developer, or looking for the latest release version, this is the place to go.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notify/introduction/","title":"mSupply Notify System"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notify/scheduled/":{"body":"It's often useful to be able to schedule a notification on a regular basis, for example you might want to get a summary of out of stock items from your store every monday morning, or a list of sites that haven't successfully synced in the last 24 hours.\nThe scheduled reports plugin allows you to create reports like this.\n\nNote: Right now, scheduled reports don't contain any conditional logic, so you can't create a report that only sends if there are out of stock items, or only sends if there are sites that haven't synced in the last 24 hours. This is something we may add in the future, or we may create another plugin that allows you to do this.\n\nTo configure a scheduled notification, go to Notifications and click New Notification.\nSelect Scheduled from dropdown, and assign a name to your notification.\n\nAfter clicking Create, you'll be taken to the edit page for your notification.\n\nSelecting Recipients🔗\nThe first thing you'll need to do is select the recipients for your notification.\nClick the box under the Recipients label to select the recipients, you can search for and select recipients, recipient, lists or sql recipient lists.\n\nBasic Templating🔗\nThere are two templates for each scheduled report.\nThe first is the Subject template, currently is only used for the subject of the email that will be sent.\nThe second is the Body template, this is used for the body of the email and/or the text of the telegram message.\nThese templates are written using Markdown, and Tera templates.\nAs a very simple example, you could use the following template for the body of your email:\n# Hello {{ recipient.name }}\n\n\nThe system will replace {{ recipient.name }} with the name of the recipient, when sending the email or telegram message.\n\nYou can also use data from any associated queries in your templates, for example if you have a query called out_of_stock_items that returns a list of out of stock items, you could use a template like this to list them in the body of your email:\n# Hello {{ recipient.name }}\n\nHere are the items that are out of stock:\n{% for item in out_of_stock_items %}\n- {{ item.name }}\n{% endfor %}\n\nIf your query returns only 1 row, you need to access the data using query_name.0.column_name, for example if you have a query with the number of sites that haven't syncd in the last 24 hours, you would need to use a template like this:\n# Hello {{ recipient.name }}\n\n{{ sites_not_synced.0.count }} sites have not synced in the last 24 hours!\n\nScheduling the Notification🔗\nTo schedule the notification, you need to set a Starting From datetime, and a Repeat Interval.\n\nStarting From specifies the date and time that the first notification will be sent on.\nThe repeat interval can be set to Daily, Weekly or Monthly.\nIf Monthly is selected, and the Starting From date is the 31st of the month, the notification will be sent on the last day of every month, even if the month doesn't have 31 days.\nTo test the notification configuration, set the Starting From date 1 minute from now, Enable the configuration and click Save.\nConfiguring Queries🔗\nIf you have any queries associated with your notification, you'll need to configure them before the notification will work.\nTo configure a query, click the Select Queries button, and then choose the queries you want to run when the notification is sent.\n\nTo create new queries, you need to go the Queries page, and click New Query. This process is described in more detail in the Queries section.\nIn this example, we have a query with a reference_name : out_of_stock_items that has a parameter called store_id.\n\nThe data from each sql query is accessed using it's reference name, so in this case, we would access the data using out_of_stock_items.\nParameters🔗\nIf the queries you've selected have parameters, you'll need to configure them before the notification will work.\nAny required parameters for the queries you have selected will be listed under the Parameters tab.\n\nIf you want the notification to run multiple times, with different parameters, you can add multiple parameter sets.\nThis can be done by clicking the duplicate button next to the parameter set.\n\nIf you have more than one parameter set, the notification will run once for each parameter set. This means if you setup a lot of parameter sets, you could end up with a lot of notifications being sent.\n\nNote: Using SQL Recipients, you can control which recipients receive notifications for each parameter set.\n\nParameter sets can be entered by a parameter JSON object, this also allows you to add other parameters you might want to use in your templates.\n\nParameters are accessed directly in a template, see {{ store_name }} in the example below:\n# Hello {{ recipient.name }}\n\nHere are the items that are out of stock at {{ store_name }}:\n{% for item in out_of_stock_items %}\n- {{ item.name }}\n{% endfor %}\n\n\nNote: if your query's reference name is the same as one of your parameters, the query will replace the parameter in the template, making it unavailable.\n\nHints🔗\n\nYou can use a special variable {{__tera_context}} to view all the data that is available in your template which can be useful for debugging.\nIf your sql queries fail to run, this can cause the whole notification to fail, check the Notification Events page to see if there are any errors.\nTelegram is really picky with what kinds of data it will accept, if you're having trouble sending a telegram message, there's some more information about the format of the data here.\nIt's definitely possible to do maths in your template if desired, see the tera docs for more information https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#math\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notify/scheduled/","title":"Scheduled
