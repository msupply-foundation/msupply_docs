This User Guide contains external links to Grafana information pages to explain various concepts and how to edit your current dashboard and create new dashboards.\nDashboards and Panels\nEach Dashboard is composed of editable Panels arranged on a grid. The panels are separated by rows and can be dragged-and-dropped to a different location on the grid. Each panel queries your mSupply data to give you information in a visual form (graph, table etc).\nStore login permissions to determine data visibility\nThe dashboards can be configured such that data visibility is controlled according to the store login permissions of the user. This can be an efficient way of managing dashboards. Instead of having a large range of very similar dashboards where the only difference between them is the user / store who's data is visible, you can have just one dashboard, where different users will see data according to the stores which they have permission to log in to.\nFlexibility\nYou can view and share data from your dashboard, change the appearance and type of data the panels in your dashboard show, and create new dashboards customised to suit your needs.\nFor a detailed overview refer to Grafana Dashboard Concepts\nSetting up Users\nYou can login to the dashboard using your current mSupply login. An account is created for you automatically in the grafana system with standard viewer-level permissions. If you are to have an editor or administrator role, then Sustainable Solutions, or another administrative user, can set that up for you after you have logged in for the first time.\nTo use the dashboard, an mSupply user must be configured to:\n\nUse the Dashboard.\n\n\n\nHave Active status enabled.\n\n\n\nIf your dashboard is filtering store data according to the user's permission to log in to the store (recommendethen you will need to:\n\n\nEnter an email address for the user.\n\n\n\nConfigure the user to be able to log in to the stores for which you want them to have access.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than these, no other special configuration of the mSupply user account is required - including any permissions in any of the stores.\n\nValid Grafana user names are more restrictive than mSupply. For example, if the mSupply user name contains a hyphen (-) then Grafana will not accept that user name.\n    John Doe **is** valid\n    John-Doe **is not** valid\n\nUsers may need to have their mSupply username, which was working perfectly, amended in order for them to be able to log in to the Dashboard.\nLogging In\nUsers log in by entering the URL address of dashboard on a web browser.\nThe oauth (mSupply login) app requires something that Internet Explorer doesn't support. You must use another browser to log in to the mSupply dashboards.\nAlso, just STOP USING Internet Explorer - it's dangerous!\nWhen you log in you may see a suite of dashboards similar to the example below.\nThis example is showing the 'Overview' Dashboard.\nIt is set to a Time Range of 'Previous year'\nThis Dashboard example contains six Panels:\n\nTotal stock value\nStock status\nStock value by store\nTransactions per store\nMonths of stock by region\nStock history over time by store\n\n\nNavigation menus\nLet's walk through the navigation menus\n\n\n\nOverview - This is the dashboard you are viewing.

However, you have the possibility to issue a quantity of packs instead by changing the value in the second dropdown (Pack Size). \nDefault value is Any when you are issuing units. \n\nList of available batches:\nThis is a list of batch numbers that you have in store for this item: \n\n# Packs: Number of packs to be issued\nPack Size: Quantity of units per pack\nUnit Qty: Total quantity of units to be issued\nAvailable: Number of packs available (not already allocated to other shipments)\nIn store: Total number of packs in your store\nBatch: Batch number.

You cannot issue a batch that is on hold. \nPlaceholder: The placeholder line is used when the quantity you are issuing is higher than your available stock\n\n\nIssue a quantity of units\nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units, regardless of the pack size (number of units in a pack). \nWhen entering a number in the Issue Quantity field, system automatically chooses the batch number(s) with the shortest expiry date (First to Expire, First Out or FEFO logic). \n\nIn below example, we are issuing 100 units of the item. All 100 units will be taken from the same batch (second row). First batch was not selected because it is expired. \n\n\n\nIn this other example, we are issuing 1200 units. System selects two batches with different pack sizes. \n\n\nNote that in this list, the batches which are available for selection are shown first and batches which are not (on hold or no stock available) are shown below and in a grey font.\nIssue a quantity of packs\nYou can decide to issue a quantity of packs. To do this, you can change the value in the Pack Size dropdown. \n\nLet's imagine that your customer only wants pack size of 12 units. You can change the dropdown value from `Any` to `12`. \n\n\nYou are now offered to issue a number of packs of 12 units. Only batch number(s) with a pack size of 12 units can be automatically issued.\n\nIn below example, we are issuing 10 packs of 12 units:\n\n\n\n if you had previously entered a quantity of units and you switch to a quantity a packs, the quantity of units will automatically be converted into the correct quantity of packs.  \n\n\nWhen a pack size is selected, and stock lines which have a different pack size are not available for selection. As such, those rows are listed lower down in the table and are shown in a grey font, in the same way as other unavailable rows.\nManual Allocation\nRegardless if you chose to issue a quantity of units or packs, you can always manually change the quantity at the batch number level directly before pressing on OK. \nYou simply have to enter or edit the quantity in the # Packs column. \nThe main Issue Quantity field will be automatically updated with the new quantity.\n\n  when allocating quantities at the batch number level, the quantity you enter is always a quantity of packs. \n\n\n\nManual allocation at the batch number level.\n\nIssuing when there is not enough stock (Placeholder Line)\nIf the amount to be issued is greater than the total stock available from all of the available lines, then the quantity to be issued will automatically be placed in the placeholder field, at the bottom of the list of available batch numbers. \nPlaceholder lines can be allocated later when new stock arrives. However, all shipment lines must be allocated before confirming the allocation. \n\nSince there is no stock available for 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml, system is issuing a 100 units in the placeholder field. \n\n\nWhen you look at an Outbound Shipment, you can see if a shipment line has not been allocated or has been partially allocated when it is higlighted in blue. \n\nConfirm Item and Quantity\nWhen you are happy with the quantity, you can either press on:\n\nthe OK button.

Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).\nNote that the lists show are those which are visible to the customer of the shipment.\n\nClick OK on the prompt:\n\nYou will then have unallocated (placeholder) lines added to your shipment, which will then look like this:\n\nAs you can see - all of the quantities are zero. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.\nEditing an Outbound Shipment Line\nTo edit an shipment line, tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen. \nEdit a Shipment Line\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status lower than Shipped. \n\n\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit. \n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit.\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list. \nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs\n\n\n\n  You can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nProcessing an Outbound Shipment\nAllocating an Outbound Shipment\nAllocation is the process of assigning one or multiple batch numbers from the inventory to a shipment line. In other words, you are assigning stock to your shipment. Once allocated, the stock is reserved for the shipment and thus for your customer. \nThere are 2 main ways to allocate a shipment line: \n\n\nWhen adding items, system is automatically assigning stock to the new shipment line when you enter a quantity. If you don't have enough stock, system will add placeholder lines (unallocated lines). \n\n\nBulk action Allocate placeholder lines: \n\nSelect the lines that you want to allocate by checking boxes on the right on the list\nIn the Actions dropdown menu, select Allocate placeholder lines. System will check if there is available stock for each selected lines and allocate them using the First to Expire, First Out (FEFO) logic. A notification will let you know whether the operation is successful or not. \n\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to process your Outbound Shipment if you have unallocated lines (shipment lines without batch number(s) assigned to it) with a quantity greater than 0. You can wait for more stock to arrive or you can delete the placeholder lines. Any unallocated lines with a 0 quantity will automatically be removed for you when you allocate.\n\nConfirming an Outbound Shipment's allocation\nOnce you all your shipments lines have been allocated, you can confirm the allocation:\n\nCurrent status of the shipment has to be NEW\nLines must be assigned with one or several batch numbers. You won't be able to confirm the allocation if your shipment contains lines without batch numbers assigned to it (placeholder lines). \n\nTo confirm the allocation, press the Confirm Allocated button. \n\nOnce the allocation is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is ALLOCATED\nYou are now invited to confirm the picking via the Confirm Picked button\nAll the items and their quantities will be reserved, meaning that they are no longer available for allocation\nYou can print a pick slip to be sent to your warehouse so they can start preparing the shipment\n\nConfirming Outbound Shipment picking\nPicking refers to the process where individual items are picked from a fulfillment facility (usually a warehouse or a pharmacy store).\nOnce a shipment has been allocated, next step is to go get the items to prepare the actual shipment. To help with that, you are able to generate a pick slip document. A pickslip indicates:\n\nWhat are the items to be picked\nThe quantity and batch numbers for each item\nIf you manage your inventory with storage locations, where the items are located\n\nOnce all items are picked and packed. You can then confirm the picking of the shipment to indicate to indicate that it is ready to be dispatched. \nTo confirm that a shipment has been picked, tap on the Confirm Picked button. \n\nOnce picking is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now PICKED\nYou are now invited to confirm the shipping via the Confirm Shipped button\nAn Inbound Shipment has been generated and is now visible to your customer\n\nAt this stage, you are still able to edit shipment lines, to add items or to delete existing lines. However, if picking has been confirmed, you need to make sure to inform your fulfillment facility of any change so they can make sure that the shipment is still correct. \nConfirming the Outbound Shipment shipping\nThe last step to issue stock with an Outbound Shipment is to confirm that stock has been shipped. This a critical step cause when goods are confirmed as shipped, they are no longer part of your inventory records. \nTo confirm that an Outbound Shipment has been shipped, tap on the Confirm Shipped button. \nOnce shipping has been confirmed: \n\nShipment status is now SHIPPED\nGoods are  no longer part of your inventory\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\nYou can print a delivery note or an invoice\n\nTracking Progress of Outbound Shipments\nIf your customer is also using mSupply, you wil be able to see when they'll receive your shipments:\n\nstatus will become DELIVERED when goods are received: your customer confirmed that they received your goods\nstatus will become VERIFIED when shipment has been verified by your customer. Goods are now part of their inventory\n\nViewing an Outbound Shipment\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\nIf you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.\nClick on the Show / hide columns button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see. The options chosen are stored for the current browser, so next time you view an outbound shipment, you will see the selected columns only. If you have chosen which columns to show, then the button is shown in blue to remind you that there are more columns available.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound-shipments/","title":"Outbound Shipments"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/requisitions/":{"body":"When a customer orders stock from you, they create an Internal Order in their store.

You can update the storage location at any time if you haven't confirmed the verification yet. \n\nConfirm item and quantities\nWhen you're done, you can add the new line by tapping on:\n\nOKif you don't want to add another line to your shipment\nOK &amp; Nextif you have other lines to create\n\nOtherwise, you can tap on Cancel and your changes won't be saved. \nAdding lines to an Inbound Shipment using a Master List\nTap on the Add from master list button (top right corner). \n\nThe button will be disabled if the status of the Inbound Shipment is anything other than New\n\n\nA new Master Lists window opens. This allows you to select the required master list. Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).\n\nClick OK on the prompt:\n\nYou will then have placeholder lines added to your shipment, which will then look like this:\n\nThe imported rows will have zero for the number of packs value, and are therefore shown in a blue font with the batch, expiry, location etc not shown. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.\nEditing an Inbound Shipment line\nTo edit an Inbound Shipment line, simply tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen and cannot be modified. \nEdit a Shipment Line\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status higher lower than Verified. \n\n\n\nOpen the Inbound Shipment you want to edit\n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line\n\nOpen the Inbound Shipment that you would like to edit\nMake sure that status is not yet VERIFIED\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list\nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs\n\n\n\nYou can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nReceiving stock with an Inbound Shipment\nConfirm the delivery of the shipment\nWhether your Inbound Shipment is manual or automatic, the first step to receive the goods is to confirm the delivery. \nAt this stage, you don't have to check if quantities or other information are correct, you just have to acknowledge that you have received the goods from your supplier. \nTo confirm that an Inbound Shipment has been delivered, click on the Confirm Delivered button. \n\nIn case your Inbound Shipment is automatic, you cannot confirm its delivery unless the supplier has confirmed its shipment. In other words, your shipment status has to be SHIPPED before you can confirm that you have received the goods. \n\n\nAny unallocated lines with a 0 number of packs value will automatically be removed for you when you confirm.\n\nVerify your Inbound Shipment\nVerification is the last step to receive goods in mSupply. At this stage, you can check what you have received and make sure that that information in mSupply are correct. \nYou have the possibility to verify the following information: \n\nBatch numbers and their expiry dates\nQuantity of packs and pack size \nPricing information: cost and sell prices\n\nYou can also capture where received goods are to be stored in the Location tab. \nOnce all information have been captured or verified, you can confirm the Shipment as VERIFIED by tapping on the Confirm Verified button. \nOnce you have done this:\n\nGoods are now part of your inventory\nShipment status is now VERIFIED\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\n\nViewing an Inbound Shipment\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\nIf you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.\nClick on the Show / hide columns button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see. The options chosen are stored for the current browser, so next time you view an inbound shipment, you will see the selected columns only. If you have chosen which columns to show, then the button is shown in blue to remind you that there are more columns available.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/inbound-shipments/","title":"Inbound Shipments"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/internal-orders/":{"body":"Internal Orders go by several other names in certain countries or systems:\n\nRequisitions\nOrders\nReport &amp; Requisition\nR&amp;R\n\nInternal Orders are a way to support users in requesting new stock from another store. \nViewing Internal Orders\nIf you would like to order some stock from your supplier: \n\nNavigate to the Replenishment menu\nTap on Internal Orders\n\n\nYou will see a list of all existing internal orders: \n\nYou can use the Search by comment field to filter the list by the comments of the internal orders: \n\nYou can sort the list using the column headers:\n\nTap the column header of the column that you want to sort.

It can run on windows, mac or linux operating systems.\nHardware Requirements\nGeneral hardware recommendations\n\n\nIn environments with regular power outages, it is highly recommended to procure Laptop machines rather than desktop machines. Laptop machines will almost always be the best solution in terms of both cost and effectiveness for these reasons:\n\nIn environments with poor quality electricity supply, laptop computers will generally be more reliable than desktop computers with UPS protection. In such environments UPS batteries will normally die within 2 years. Laptop batteries have better power management and the batteries last longer\nEven when the battery runs out on a laptop, the power management will normally cause the machine to shut down gracefully. \nLaptop computers have built-in microphone and camera for provision of support\nLaptop computers have built-in Wi-Fi adaptor for network connection\nLaptop computers are smaller and lighter than desktop computers, and so are less costly to ship.\n\n\n\nA connected printer is not absolutely necessary in every situation, but for most situations it is a requirement. An ink-jet or laser is preferable.\n\n\nBuy hardware for which good after sales support is available\n\n\nBuy brands with a reputation for quality (even if it means buying a slower/older machine)\n\n\nWindows, Mac, and, Linux hardware requirements\nHardware requirements vary widely depending on what you want to use Open mSupply for. Here's a rough guide:\nMachineTechnical MinimumRecommended\nWindows Client machine for use with server64 bit processorWindows 104 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorWindows 108 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nMac Client machine for use with server64 bit processormacOS Mojave (10.14) – macOS Big Sur (11)(Latest release of major version is required, such as 10.14.6)4 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorMac OS 10.14.6 or later8 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nWindows server64 bit processorWindows 10 Pro or Win server 20198 Gb RAM50 GB HDD/SDD volume with daily backups to an external volume64 bit processorWindows Server 2019+8 Gb RAM4 x HDD/SDD volumes, 3 configured as RAID1 or RAID5 with hot spareDaily backups to the fourth volume plus daily off-site backupsAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\nLinux client or server64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar4 Gb RAM256 Gb storage64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar8 Gb RAM256 Gb storage\nAndroid client or server64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage\n\n\nRecording stock transactions is a core Open mSupply activity. Most stock transaction data is numeric. A numeric keypad is often helpful for machines that have a lot of data entry done on them.\n\nMobile / tablet requirements\nYou are able to use a browser on a tablet to connect to an open mSupply server, and the only requirement here is a suitably fast tablet with a browser such as chrome or firefox. \nFor a stand-alone, offline, solution a mobile application is also available for android devices.\nRecommended Specifications:\nIn short, open mSupply mobile runs on Android tablets (not on phones as there is too much data to use well on small phone screens).\nThe application requires at least Android 5.0 (Lollipop)\nMinimumRecommended\nDisplay size9.8 inches10.1 inches\nResolution768 x 1024 pixels800 x 1200 pixels\nAndroid version5.08.1\nProcessorQuad-core 1.3GHz\nMemory1.5 Gb RAM\n\nIn order to provide support, the device must also be compatible with MDM (Mobile Device Management) software and support google services. Please contact mSupply Foundation for details.\nPlease contact us for testing and / or advice before making a large hardware purchase.\nSmart UPS\nA 'smart' UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) detects when the battery power is about to run out and sends a notification to software on the server which triggers a graceful shut down of the computer. To enable this, there needs to be a cable connection (normally USB) between the UPS and the computer combined with software running on the computer.\nIn our experience, the primary cause of computer hardware failure is data corruption due to ungraceful shutdowns. This happens when power to the computer is cut instantly, without any notification to the computer to shut down gracefully. If the machine is 'protected' by a normal UPS, then this can still happen when the battery power runs out. Even if the machine is notionally protected by a 'smart' UPS, there are a number of circumstances where this UPS protection fails:\n\nCable connection and software can fail.\n\nCable becomes disconnected\nSoftware isn't configured correctly\nSoftware doesn't start up\n\n\nUPS batteries degrade (normally within 2 years of installation in environments with regular power cuts) and there is too little capacity to run long enough for the computer to shut down gracefully after receiving the notification from the UPS\n\nLaptop computers tend to be much more resilient to power failure:\n\nA laptop's built-in 'smart' UPS is very reliable\nThe internal batteries last much longer than UPS batteries\nEven if the laptop internal battery degrades, the 'smart' function appears to work much more reliably than a standalone UPS communicating with a 'tower' computer.\n\nHere are some additional advantages of laptops vs. desktop machines:\n\nLower cost of freight:\n\nTo send the machine to site\nTo send spare parts for repair on-site\nTo retrieve the machine from site for any repairs that can not be undertaken on site\n\n\nIt is standard to have features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and camera included by default and this may not be the case with desktops\n\nA concern with laptop computers is security. It is easier to steal a laptop computer from an office than it is to steal a desktop computer. For this reason, laptops are normally configured with a physical locking feature such as Kensington lock slot.\nBecause Open mSupply is dealing with lots of numbers (quantities of stock), it is highly recommended to have a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Smaller laptop computers (14“ screen or less) will not have this. Smaller laptop computers normally have an impractically small screen. It is therefore recommended to procure a laptop computer with a keyboard that includes a numeric keypad - which will necessarily entail a larger screen.\nUseful productivity accessories for laptop computers include\n\nExternal mouse (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal keyboard (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal screen\n\nBackup system\nOnce you start using Open mSupply, it is of crucial importance that you have a method of backing up your data. In a default installation, Open mSupply stores all its data in a file that rapidly becomes large. You need, therefore, to have a high capacity removable storage device. We strongly recommend the use of an external hard disk using either firewire (IEEE 1394) or USB2 to facilitate off-site storage of backups.\n\nIf not using our internet backup service, you need to be able to store backed up data off-site to prevent the risk of loss by fire, theft, etc.\n\nAntivirus\nWindows based operating systems are particularly prone to malware if precautions are not taken. We recommend the following precautions:\n\nInstall a reputable anti-virus program, including web protection if the computer has access to the internet\nDisable USB ports - refer to this site for suggested methods\n\nEnsure that access to passwords to allow exceptions to the above two measures are kept secure.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/roadmap/":{"body":"This road map will be updated about once every six weeks.\nIt only covers our immediate committed work stream.

We like Firefox, but Chrome and its myriad children will also suffice.\nEnter the web address (URL) of your mSupply server. In our case we're using https://demo-open.msupply.org - our test web site.\nAfter pressing  on your keyboard you'll be shown the login page\n\n\n\nEnter your user name and password and press  on your keyboard, or click the [Log in] button\n\nAll going well, you'll be redirected to the dashboard page.\nIf there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:\n\nTry re-typing the username and password (note that both are case-sensitive).\nWhen you log in, the default store for your user is selected as the current store. If you have access to other stores, you'll be able to change stores after logging in (see below).\nIf you have logged in previously, and changed stores, then the most recent store will be selected for you when you log in.\nNavigating around\nThe main menu is on the left side of the screen. If you have a small screen size, then it will be collapsed by default - for larger screens it will instead be open by default.\nTo open and close you can click on the logo at the top, as shown below. The menu remains either open or closed once you have selected an option.\nIf the menu is closed, simply hovering over the menu items will open it, in which case clicking on an item will let the menu close again. If you are on a tablet, clicking on a menu item will have the same effect.\n\nOn some screens you'll see that the header shows a heading, such as Outbound Shipment in the example above. Clicking on a specific shipment then changes that heading to Outbound Shipment/ #[the shipment number]. You are able to click on the Outbound Shipment part to return to the list - or use the main navigation on the left.\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThere are keyboard shortcuts used throughout open mSupply. Rather than remember them all, to get started you simply have to remember the combination control (ctrl)+k (windows and linux) or cmd (⌘)+k (mac)\nThis will bring up the following window, no matter which page you are on:\n\nThis shows you the list of globally available shortcuts, for example pressing d on your keyboard will take you to the dashboard (unless you are entering text into an input field!).\nHowever, you can also click on an item in the list, or search available commands:\n\nIn addition - there are various places where specific keyboard shortcuts are available. An example is the tab control used in both Stocktakes and Inbound Shipments. Here you can use control+1 to navigate to the first tab (Quantities) or control+2 for the second tab (Pricing) etc. If you press + on your keyboard, you can add a new batch.\n\nFooter\nThe bottom of the screen contains some useful information and is shown on every screen\n\nSome users have access to more than one store. To change the store which is currently selected, simply click on the store name in the footer:\n\nYou will see the notification and the store name in the footer will be updated.

Other relevant pages include:\n\nSetup instructions\nRecording Adverse Drug Reactions\nDashboards for Vaccination Monitoring\nWeb portal entry of Registrations and Adverse Events\n\nIntroduction\nmSupply mobile has handled dispensing since 2019, and cold chain equipment monitoring since version 7 (March 2021).\nNow it also has a specific workflow for vaccine dispensing. This differs from normal dispensing in several important ways\n\nPatient registration collects a lot more data than what is typically required for dispensing a prescription, such as\n\nHas the patient ever had Covid-19 before?\nIs the patient pregnant?\nIs the patient lactating?\nHas the patient ever had an adverse reaction to a vaccine previously?\n\n\nThe dispensing workflow is greatly simplified\n\nWhen an existing patient is chosen, the extra information fields are chosen, as many of them are time-dependent, so the current value for the field might be different from the saved value. For instance, the patient might not have been pregnant when they were recorded in the system some weeks or months ago, but they are now.\nOnly items marked as vaccines are shown, so there is no need to type in the item name- you simply choose from the list.\nThe dispensed quantity is always one, so no quantity field needs filling out.\nThe vaccine batch and VVM status are shown, and the batch used can be selected.\nIf using multi-dose vials, the batch with an open vial is chosen by default.\nYou can record that the patient refused vaccination.\nYou can record who the vaccinator was.\n\n\nAdverse Reaction Reporting is added to the system.\n\nThe adverse reaction reporting data that is collected is configurable on the server, so can vary depending on the vaccination campaign being run at the time. Further documentation is available here\n\n\n\nSetup\nSetup is technical and needs to be done carefully. We know you're careful ;-)\nHere are the instructions\nUsing the module\nOnce Setup is complete, you'll end up with an mobile navigation screen that looks like this:\n\nStep one: Patient details\n\nNote that each step has a Cancel button which will cancel the process\nYou can also press on any one of the three steps along the top of the window  after they’ve been completed to revisit that step and edit details if needed.\nSelecting a patient\n\nSearch by last name, first name and Date of birth\n\nIn the example below, we've entered the first and last name exactly, and the date of birth. Amazingly, there is only one match!\n\n\nWhen typing, we look up in your local database first. If the patient still doesn’t come up, click the Search online button, which will use the same search information you have already entered and send a request to your cloud server to see if the patient exists anywhere in your system.\n\nNOTE: Requires the internet\nIf you still can’t find the patient, click “New Patient”\nIf you do find your patient, click on the row to go to step 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively (as of v8.1.0), it is possible to lookup patients by QR Code (provided these details have been loaded into mSupply). \n\nUpon tapping the Scan QR Code button a window will appear with a camera view. \nAs soon as a QR Code is found in the viewfinder mSupply mobile will attempt to first search in your local database for a patient that matches the QR Code scanned. \nIf the patient was not found locally and there is internet available, a search will then be sent to your cloud server to see if the patient exists anywhere in your system. \nIf the patient was still not found after a search on the cloud server (or internet is not available), you will get a message indicating that no patient was found, and will arrive back at the manual entry page, where you can either enter details manually (as per above) or try another QR Code.\n\n\n\n\nStep two: Add or edit patient information\n\nAfter choosing a patient, you're shown the standard mSupply information for the patient in the left-hand panel, and any extra information that you have configured in the right-hand panel.\nStep three: Additional vaccination details\n\nNote that this third step is only available from mobile v8.1.0 onwards, and requires a form to be configured on the mSupply server for it to display. The form configuration drives the content shown in step three.\nIf using v8.0.X, or a form is not configured on the server, there will only be three steps total shown in the vaccine dispensing flow (step three will instead be dispense a vaccine. )\nStep four: Dispense a vaccine\n\nHere you can select who the vaccinator is - these will be set up on your primary server\nYou can also select which vaccine you are giving to the patient. The one which was dispensed most recently will be auto-selected for you.\nYou can also select which batch the patient received. The batch which is open and with the most recent expiry will be auto-selected for you.\nAlternatively, you can select REFUSE VACCINE which will note that the patient refused to be vaccinated\nTapping Confirm will send you back to the menu page.\nTapping OK &amp; Next will allow you to vaccinate another patient.\n\n\nRefused vaccinations\nIf the patient refuses to be vaccinated, then check the Refused vaccine checkbox at the top-right. \n\nA text field will then become available to record a reason for the refusal.\nA note will be recorded on the patient's file with the date of refusal, and the reason (if one was specified).\nAdverse Reactions\nYou can record an adverse drug reaction (ADR), or specifically in this case, an Adverse event from immunisation (AEFI).\nAs this is not restricted to vaccines, the functionality is described in a separate page here\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/vaccine-dispensing/","title":"Vaccine dispensing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/vaccine/":{"body":"This functionality is available from mSupply mobile v7.0.0 onwards\nCold Chain (for Vaccines and other Cold chain items)\nSetting up to use the Vaccine module\nVaccine mode only shows if the store is configured correctly on the server, with the preference 'mobile: Uses vaccine module' enabled. Read how here\nPermissions and Services\nThe vaccine module requires additional permissions and services to be enabled on your mobile device. \nWhen all permissions and services required for Mobile ColdChain are enabled, the 'cog icon' will be in the mSupply Mobile title line (top right of your mobile screen):\n\nHowever, if some required permissions and services are disabled, the 'hazard icon' will be in the mSupply Mobile title line:\n\nIf your title line shows that some permissions and services are disabled, press on the 'hazard icon' to open the Permissions and Services window.\nAny permission or service that is disabled will be indicated with a 'cross icon' as below:\n\nTo enable, simply press on the cross icon next to the permission or service.  Your device will prompt you to enable the permission or service.\n\nPress Allow.\nOnce all of the permissions and services have been enabled, your window will look like this:\n\nApproved mSupply Temperature Sensors\nThe following is a list of approved temperature sensors that will work together with mSupply ColdChain and mSupply Mobile: Vaccines.  These sensors have been approved by the World Health Organisation as a temperature monitoring device suitable for use in immunization programmes.\n*Blue Maestro Tempo Disc™ Waterproof IP67 Bluetooth Temperature Sensor Beacon and Logger Download PDF.\nApproved sensors can be purchased directly from the manufacturer or reseller online.  Please contact coldchain@msupply.foundation for further information.\nAdding Sensors\nThe first time you use the Vaccine module, there will be no sensors connected to your device.\n\nTap Add Sensor to start the three-step process to add a sensor.\nPlease make sure that you have an approved mSupply temperature sensor.  Only approved sensors can be connected to mSupply Mobile. \nWe recommend you keep the sensor close when you are adding or editing it within mSupply Mobile.  Also, allow for up to a minute for any changes to be communicated via Bluetooth. \nIf you are using a brand new sensor, press the top of the sensor until it flashes to turn it on.\nStep 1: Select the correct sensor\nWhen you tap Add Sensor, your device will scan and list any sensors that can be connected by Bluetooth.\n\nIf you tap the BLINK button, the LED light for that sensor will flash.  You can use this to make sure that you are connecting the correct sensor. \nWhen you are sure that you have the correct sensor, tap Connect for that sensor.\nStep 2: Sensor Thresholds\nFirstly, some definitions:\n\nConsecutive means a single event where the temperature stays over (or under) the threshold for the whole time. So if you have a threshold of 8 degrees, and a consecutive breach time of 10 minutes, then a breach that lasts for 6 minutes, then drops under the threshold for 2 minutes, then breaches again for 6 minutes is not a consecutive breach, but the 2 x 6 minute breaches are added to the cumulative breach records.\nCumulative means adding together the total time over a certain temperature for a series of breaches.\n\nNow we can set the temperature breach conditions for the sensor.  There are four thresholds that you can define:\n\n\nHot Consecutive\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature above this value for longer than the specified time. Using the +/- buttons, select the maximum temperature and minimum duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nCold Consecutive\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature below this value for longer than the specified time. Using the +/- buttons, select the minimum temperature and minimum duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nHot Cumulative\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature above this value for longer than the total specified time specified (total time is calculated as the sum of all breach times). Using the +/- buttons, select the maximum temperature and minimum total duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nCold Cumulative\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature below this value for longer than the total specified time specified (total time is calculated as the sum of all breach times). Using the +/- buttons, select the minimum temperature and minimum total duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\n\nTIP: It is possible to long press the +/- buttons to change the values faster.\nTap Back if you wish to return to Step 1 and check that you have the correct sensor.\nTap Next to move to Step 3.\nTap Cancel if you no longer want to add the sensor.\nStep 3: Sensor connection\nIn this final step you need to enter:\n*Sensor Name: enter a new name for the sensor. This is the name which will appear within mSupply mobile. You should choose a name to make it easy to identify the sensor.\n*Sensor Code: enter a short name code for the sensor. You should choose a code that is unique for each sensor.\nTIP: For reporting purposes, we recommend that you do not use special characters such as “-, +, *” etc in either the Sensor Name or Sensor Code fields. \n*Logging Interval: using the +/- buttons, select the length of time between temperature logs.  You can set the logging interval to any length between 1 and 30 minutes. The default logging interval is 5 minutes.\n*Start Logging: Use the +/- buttons to select the delay in minutes from now of the first temperature log. The sensor can be configured to start a maximum of 30 days from the current date.\nWhen setting the schedule for the first temperature log, allow sufficient time for the sensor to be placed in its desired location and adjust to the location’s temperature. 20 minutes should be sufficient in most situations.\n\nTap Connect to complete sensor setup and add the sensor to mSupply mobile.  This will return you to the mSupply mobile vaccine home screen and you will see the sensor has been added.\nTap Back if you wish to return to Step 2 and edit the sensor thresholds (temperature breach conditions).\nTap Cancel if you no longer want to add the sensor.\n\nWe recommend that each device should be linked to a maximum of six sensors. Each sensor should only be linked to one device. \nEdit Sensor\nTo edit sensor details, you can tap on the ‘’cog’’ icon on the mSupply Vaccine home page (above screenshot) or on the Sensor Detail screen.\nScreenshot\nAll sensor threshold and sensor connection details are editable except for the start Logging date and time.  Simply tap on the field that you wish to end and make changes.\n\nNo changes will be made until you tap Save.\nNOTE: Depending on your proximity to the sensor and the Bluetooth capabilities of your device, changes can take a few minutes.\nPausing Sensor Downloads\nThe edit screen also allows you to Pause temperature logging by the sensor.  When a sensor has been paused, it will appear in the title line both on the mSupply mobile vaccine home screen as well as the Sensor Detail screen.\n\nReplacing a Sensor\nTapping Replace will open up the scanner and allow you to choose from list of alternative sensors.  The list will only show sensors that are not currently connected to your device.\n\nFrom the list, select the replacement sensor.  You can press Blink to check that you have the correct sensor (the LED light will flash for this sensor).\nDeleting a Sensor\nTap Remove to remove any sensor no longer being used. You will receive a prompt to confirm the deletion.\n\nUsing the Vaccine module\nEnabling the Vaccine module will change the look of your menu page, adding an extra Vaccines button. \n\nSupplier Invoices\nWith vaccine module enabled you automatically get a few extra columns on a supplier invoice for vaccines - the Location and Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM) status columns.\n\nYou can select a location by tapping on the arrow icon in the Location cell. This will allow you to choose a location from a list. \n\nYou can also change the Vaccine vial monitor status for items that have been defined as vaccines on the cloud server - this defaults to the lowest level, but can be edited by clicking on the arrow icon in the VVM Status column.\n\nCustomer Invoices\nVaccine module automatically adds two extra columns on a customer invoice - the Doses and Breach columns. \n\n\nThe Doses column is for the number of doses actually used (so we can account for open-vial wastage). It will automatically get populated by the item quantity * number of doses in a vial, for convenience, but you can also edit it! There is a maximum limit of the number of doses in a vial for that vaccine * the quantity, though.\nThe Breach column shows when a vaccine item has been in a temperature breach. Note that without entering a quantity into the customer invoice for the item, we don’t know exactly what batches are being issued, so the breach icon may not show up yet.\nIf the breach icon (an orange triangle with an exclamation) does show for a row, this signals that the stock line has had a temperature breach. Tapping the icon will bring up a graph of the temperature breach. In the example below, the fridge seems to be broken, probably not a good idea to use this batch!\n\n\nSupplier Requisitions\nTapping on a row in your supplier requisition will show you the date of the last requisition for your vaccine, as well as other details such as the open and closed vial wastage since the last requisition. \n\nStocktakes\nTapping on a stocktake row for a vaccine item will also show the additional columns for Doses and Breach. \n\nHere, you can adjust the quantities of your vaccine if needed, change the location, or if the vaccine vial monitor status has changed, you can update that here. You can also view the breaches the batch has been in to help you make decisions!\nVaccine home page\nTapping on the Vaccines button in the menu page will bring you to a list of all the temperature sensors connected to your device and an overview of current status and actions for each sensor.\n\nThe sensor header displays the following information:\n*Circle: a green circle indicates that the sensor is currently within the specified temperature range and the sensor battery is equal or above 25%. A red circle indicates that the sensor is currently outsides the specified temperature range or the sensor battery is below 25%.\n*Sensor Name:  as configured during sensor connection.\n*WiFi Icon and last log time: the time of the last temperature download occurred.  The time will flash when download is currently in process.\n*Battery Icon: a percentage figure and icon showing remaining battery charge for the sensor.\n*Down Arrow Icon: Tap to export sensor data (temperature logs and breaches) to csv format and send via email data.\n*Light Bulb Icon: Tap to make the sensor LED light flash/blink.\n*Cog Button: Tap if you wish to edit the sensor configuration.\nThe row under the sensor header displays the following information:\n*Sensor’s MAC address\n*Thermometer icon and last recorded temperature\n*Clock Icon and the time of the last temperature breach (if applicable)\nTap anywhere on a sensor box to view further details.\nSensor Detail\n\nTap on the date range on the top left of the screen to change the time (and data) displayed.\nThe header information is as above.\nTemperature Graph\nThe red line represents the hot consecutive threshold.  The blue line represents the cold consecutive threshold. (You can set these here).

The following information is provided about the item:\n\nItem Code and Item Name: as per your mSupply item list details\nCurrent Stock: how much stock currently available in your facility\nMonthly Use: how much stock your facility uses each month on average (based on a configurable number of months (refer Store Preferences tab), but defaults to 3).\nSuggested Quantity: how much stock mSupply Mobile suggests that you order.  This is calculated as:\n\nMonthly Use x Max MOS - Current Stock\nSo, for the above example for Ibuprofen 200mg tablets,  Suggested Quantity = (453 x 2) - 80 = 827\n\n\n\n\nWhat should Max MOS be set to?\nMax MOS = Lead time + Order cycle + Buffer stock\n\nLead time:  The time between creating the requisition and receiving the stock.  For most facilities using mSupply Mobile, we can hope that this will be no more than 1 month\nOrder cycle:  This is the frequency of ordering.  If it is every month, this will be 1, if it is once per quarter, then this will be 3.\nBuffer stock:  This is the safety margin of stock that the facility plans for.  The safety margin accounts for things such as an order being missed, or delivery delayed.  A common approach is to set this to twice the Order cycle.\n\nSo, if we have:\n\nLead time = 1\nOrder cycle = 1\nBuffer stock = 2 x 1 = 2\n\nThen:\n\nMax MOS = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\n\n\nRequested Quantity: This is set to zero by default. You can do either of the following:\n\nAccept the Suggested Quantities by tapping on the Use Suggested Quantities button.  This populates all cells.\nChange the values manually by tapping in the cell and changing the number.  You can also do this after accepting the Suggested Quantities by tapping on the Use Suggested Quantities button.\n\n\n\nLarger Orders\nIf you have a lot of items to order (for example, when you are placing your main order), it can be slow to add them one by one.\nTo add a lot of items at once, tap Add Master List Items. \n\nSelect one or more master lists by tapping on the check box next to the master list (the row will turn orange once selected). Only master lists visible to your store are shown. In this example, there is only one master list available. Once you have made your selection, tap Done.\n\nThe items on the selected master list(s) will then automatically appear in the supplier requisition.\n\nThe columns are the same as above for adding New Item.\nUse Suggested Quantities\nIf you tap Use Suggested Quantities on the requisition header, mSupply Mobile will automatically copy the values in the Suggested Quantity column into the Requested Quantity column.\n\nPlease note, when you tap Use Suggested Quantities, this will overwrite any value that had previously been entered in the Requested Quantity column.  However, you can still manually overwrite the amount of stock requested for each item afterward.\nCreate Automatic Order\nIf you tap Create Automatic Order on the requisition header, mSupply Mobile will automatically create a supplier requisition with all items stocked at your facility (from all Master Lists) that require stock.  That is, any item at your facility that has a suggested quantity greater than zero will be listed. The Requested Quantity column will also be filled with the suggested quantity value.\n\nOnce again, you can still check the amount of stock requested for each item and change if required.\nFinalising a Supplier Requisition\nTap the Finalise button, then Confirm and your order will go to the supply store.\n\nEven if you don't have a current internet connection, it's ok! The order will send automatically once your device is able to connect to the internet.\n\nRemember:\nA Supplier Requisition is an order that you have placed with your supplier. \nA Supplier Invoice is a record of what your supplier has actually sent you.\nThese are not always the same, as your supplier might not have enough stock to fill your requisition, or they might have sent you some extra stock.
