This User Guide contains external links to Grafana information pages to explain various concepts and how to edit your current dashboard and create new dashboards.\nDashboards and Panels\nEach Dashboard is composed of editable Panels arranged on a grid. The panels are separated by rows and can be dragged-and-dropped to a different location on the grid. Each panel queries your mSupply data to give you information in a visual form (graph, table etc).\nStore login permissions to determine data visibility\nThe dashboards can be configured such that data visibility is controlled according to the store login permissions of the user. This can be an efficient way of managing dashboards. Instead of having a large range of very similar dashboards where the only difference between them is the user / store who's data is visible, you can have just one dashboard, where different users will see data according to the stores which they have permission to log in to.\nFlexibility\nYou can view and share data from your dashboard, change the appearance and type of data the panels in your dashboard show, and create new dashboards customised to suit your needs.\nFor a detailed overview refer to Grafana Dashboard Concepts\nSetting up Users\nYou can login to the dashboard using your current mSupply login. An account is created for you automatically in the grafana system with standard viewer-level permissions. If you are to have an editor or administrator role, then Sustainable Solutions, or another administrative user, can set that up for you after you have logged in for the first time.\nTo use the dashboard, an mSupply user must be configured to:\n\nUse the Dashboard.\n\n\n\nHave Active status enabled.\n\n\n\nIf your dashboard is filtering store data according to the user's permission to log in to the store (recommendethen you will need to:\n\n\nEnter an email address for the user.\n\n\n\nConfigure the user to be able to log in to the stores for which you want them to have access.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than these, no other special configuration of the mSupply user account is required - including any permissions in any of the stores.\n\nValid Grafana user names are more restrictive than mSupply. For example, if the mSupply user name contains a hyphen (-) then Grafana will not accept that user name.\n    John Doe **is** valid\n    John-Doe **is not** valid\n\nUsers may need to have their mSupply username, which was working perfectly, amended in order for them to be able to log in to the Dashboard.\nLogging In\nUsers log in by entering the URL address of dashboard on a web browser.\nThe oauth (mSupply login) app requires something that Internet Explorer doesn't support. You must use another browser to log in to the mSupply dashboards.\nAlso, just STOP USING Internet Explorer - it's dangerous!\nWhen you log in you may see a suite of dashboards similar to the example below.\nThis example is showing the 'Overview' Dashboard.\nIt is set to a Time Range of 'Previous year'\nThis Dashboard example contains six Panels:\n\nTotal stock value\nStock status\nStock value by store\nTransactions per store\nMonths of stock by region\nStock history over time by store\n\n\nNavigation menus\nLet's walk through the navigation menus\n\n\n\nOverview - This is the dashboard you are viewing.

Tab)\n\n\nExample: For the item *030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs*, there are 3527 tabs available. \n\n\nIssue [Quantity] of units in packs of [Pack Size]\nIn the Issue Quantity field, you can enter the quantity that you want to issue to your customer. \nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units. However, you have the possibility to issue a quantity of packs instead by changing the value in the second dropdown (Pack Size). \nDefault value is Any when you are issuing units. \n\nList of available batches:\nThis is a list of batch numbers that you have in store for this item: \n\n# Packs: Number of packs to be issued\nPack Size: Quantity of units per pack\nUnit Qty: Total quantity of units to be issued\nAvailable: Number of packs available (not already allocated to other shipments)\nIn store: Total number of packs in your store\nBatch: Batch number. It is a designation given to products made in the same manufacturing run. \nExpiry: Expiry date of the batch (format: MM/YYYY)\nLocation: If you inventory is managed with storage locations, the name of the location where the item is stored\nSell: Selling unit price of the item\nOn Hold: Indicate whether a batch is on hold or not. You cannot issue a batch that is on hold. \nPlaceholder: The placeholder line is used when the quantity you are issuing is higher than your available stock\n\n\nIssue a quantity of units\nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units, regardless of the pack size (number of units in a pack). \nWhen entering a number in the Issue Quantity field, system automatically chooses the batch number(s) with the shortest expiry date (First to Expire, First Out or FEFO logic). \n\nIn below example, we are issuing 100 units of the item. All 100 units will be taken from the same batch (second row). First batch was not selected because it is expired. \n\n\n\nIn this other example, we are issuing 1200 units. System selects two batches with different pack sizes. \n\n\nNote that in this list, the batches which are available for selection are shown first and batches which are not (on hold or no stock available) are shown below and in a grey font.\nIssue a quantity of packs\nYou can decide to issue a quantity of packs. To do this, you can change the value in the Pack Size dropdown. \n\nLet's imagine that your customer only wants pack size of 12 units. You can change the dropdown value from `Any` to `12`. \n\n\nYou are now offered to issue a number of packs of 12 units. Only batch number(s) with a pack size of 12 units can be automatically issued.\n\nIn below example, we are issuing 10 packs of 12 units:\n\n\n\n if you had previously entered a quantity of units and you switch to a quantity a packs, the quantity of units will automatically be converted into the correct quantity of packs.  \n\n\nWhen a pack size is selected, and stock lines which have a different pack size are not available for selection. As such, those rows are listed lower down in the table and are shown in a grey font, in the same way as other unavailable rows.\nManual Allocation\nRegardless if you chose to issue a quantity of units or packs, you can always manually change the quantity at the batch number level directly before pressing on OK. \nYou simply have to enter or edit the quantity in the # Packs column. \nThe main Issue Quantity field will be automatically updated with the new quantity.\n\n  when allocating quantities at the batch number level, the quantity you enter is always a quantity of packs. \n\n\n\nManual allocation at the batch number level.\n\nIssuing when there is not enough stock (Placeholder Line)\nIf the amount to be issued is greater than the total stock available from all of the available lines, then the quantity to be issued will automatically be placed in the placeholder field, at the bottom of the list of available batch numbers. \nPlaceholder lines can be allocated later when new stock arrives. However, all shipment lines must be allocated before confirming the allocation. \n\nSince there is no stock available for 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml, system is issuing a 100 units in the placeholder field. \n\n\nWhen you look at an Outbound Shipment, you can see if a shipment line has not been allocated or has been partially allocated when it is higlighted in blue. \n\nConfirm Item and Quantity\nWhen you are happy with the quantity, you can either press on:\n\nthe OK button. You are redirected to the Outbound Shipment view and your item has been added to the list. \nthe OK &amp; Next button to add another item right away\nthe Cancel if you do not want to add the item to the Outbound Shipment anymore\n\nAdding lines to an Outbound Shipment using a Master List\nTap on the Add from master list button (top right corner). \n\nA new Master Lists window opens. This allows you to select the required master list. Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).\nNote that the lists show are those which are visible to the customer of the shipment.\n\nClick OK on the prompt:\n\nYou will then have unallocated (placeholder) lines added to your shipment, which will then look like this:\n\nAs you can see - all of the quantities are zero. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.\nEditing an Outbound Shipment Line\nTo edit an shipment line, tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen. \nEdit a Shipment Line\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status lower than Shipped. \n\n\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit. \n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit.\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list. \nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs\n\n\n\n  You can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nProcessing an Outbound Shipment\nAllocating an Outbound Shipment\nAllocation is the process of assigning one or multiple batch numbers from the inventory to a shipment line. In other words, you are assigning stock to your shipment. Once allocated, the stock is reserved for the shipment and thus for your customer. \nThere are 2 main ways to allocate a shipment line: \n\n\nWhen adding items, system is automatically assigning stock to the new shipment line when you enter a quantity. If you don't have enough stock, system will add placeholder lines (unallocated lines). \n\n\nBulk action Allocate placeholder lines: \n\nSelect the lines that you want to allocate by checking boxes on the right on the list\nIn the Actions dropdown menu, select Allocate placeholder lines. System will check if there is available stock for each selected lines and allocate them using the First to Expire, First Out (FEFO) logic. A notification will let you know whether the operation is successful or not. \n\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to process your Outbound Shipment if you have unallocated lines (shipment lines without batch number(s) assigned to it) with a quantity greater than 0. You can wait for more stock to arrive or you can delete the placeholder lines. Any unallocated lines with a 0 quantity will automatically be removed for you when you allocate.\n\nConfirming an Outbound Shipment's allocation\nOnce you all your shipments lines have been allocated, you can confirm the allocation:\n\nCurrent status of the shipment has to be NEW\nLines must be assigned with one or several batch numbers. You won't be able to confirm the allocation if your shipment contains lines without batch numbers assigned to it (placeholder lines). \n\nTo confirm the allocation, press the Confirm Allocated button. \n\nOnce the allocation is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is ALLOCATED\nYou are now invited to confirm the picking via the Confirm Picked button\nAll the items and their quantities will be reserved, meaning that they are no longer available for allocation\nYou can print a pick slip to be sent to your warehouse so they can start preparing the shipment\n\nConfirming Outbound Shipment picking\nPicking refers to the process where individual items are picked from a fulfillment facility (usually a warehouse or a pharmacy store).\nOnce a shipment has been allocated, next step is to go get the items to prepare the actual shipment. To help with that, you are able to generate a pick slip document. A pickslip indicates:\n\nWhat are the items to be picked\nThe quantity and batch numbers for each item\nIf you manage your inventory with storage locations, where the items are located\n\nOnce all items are picked and packed. You can then confirm the picking of the shipment to indicate to indicate that it is ready to be dispatched. \nTo confirm that a shipment has been picked, tap on the Confirm Picked button. \n\nOnce picking is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now PICKED\nYou are now invited to confirm the shipping via the Confirm Shipped button\nAn Inbound Shipment has been generated and is now visible to your customer\n\nAt this stage, you are still able to edit shipment lines, to add items or to delete existing lines. However, if picking has been confirmed, you need to make sure to inform your fulfillment facility of any change so they can make sure that the shipment is still correct. \nConfirming the Outbound Shipment shipping\nThe last step to issue stock with an Outbound Shipment is to confirm that stock has been shipped. This a critical step cause when goods are confirmed as shipped, they are no longer part of your inventory records. \nTo confirm that an Outbound Shipment has been shipped, tap on the Confirm Shipped button. \nOnce shipping has been confirmed: \n\nShipment status is now SHIPPED\nGoods are  no longer part of your inventory\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\nYou can print a delivery note or an invoice\n\nTracking Progress of Outbound Shipments\nIf your customer is also using mSupply, you wil be able to see when they'll receive your shipments:\n\nstatus will become DELIVERED when goods are received: your customer confirmed that they received your goods\nstatus will become VERIFIED when shipment has been verified by your customer. Goods are now part of their inventory\n\nViewing an Outbound Shipment\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\nIf you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.\nClick on the Show / hide columns button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see.

Laptop batteries have better power management and the batteries last longer\nEven when the battery runs out on a laptop, the power management will normally cause the machine to shut down gracefully. \nLaptop computers have built-in microphone and camera for provision of support\nLaptop computers have built-in Wi-Fi adaptor for network connection\nLaptop computers are smaller and lighter than desktop computers, and so are less costly to ship.\n\n\n\nA connected printer is not absolutely necessary in every situation, but for most situations it is a requirement. An ink-jet or laser is preferable.\n\n\nBuy hardware for which good after sales support is available\n\n\nBuy brands with a reputation for quality (even if it means buying a slower/older machine)\n\n\nWindows, Mac, and, Linux hardware requirements\nHardware requirements vary widely depending on what you want to use Open mSupply for. Here's a rough guide:\nMachineTechnical MinimumRecommended\nWindows Client machine for use with server64 bit processorWindows 104 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorWindows 108 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nMac Client machine for use with server64 bit processormacOS Mojave (10.14) – macOS Big Sur (11)(Latest release of major version is required, such as 10.14.6)4 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorMac OS 10.14.6 or later8 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nWindows server64 bit processorWindows 10 Pro or Win server 20198 Gb RAM50 GB HDD/SDD volume with daily backups to an external volume64 bit processorWindows Server 2019+8 Gb RAM4 x HDD/SDD volumes, 3 configured as RAID1 or RAID5 with hot spareDaily backups to the fourth volume plus daily off-site backupsAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\nLinux client or server64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar4 Gb RAM256 Gb storage64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar8 Gb RAM256 Gb storage\nAndroid client or server64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage\n\n\nRecording stock transactions is a core Open mSupply activity. Most stock transaction data is numeric. A numeric keypad is often helpful for machines that have a lot of data entry done on them.\n\nMobile / tablet requirements\nYou are able to use a browser on a tablet to connect to an open mSupply server, and the only requirement here is a suitably fast tablet with a browser such as chrome or firefox. \nFor a stand-alone, offline, solution a mobile application is also available for android devices.\nRecommended Specifications:\nIn short, open mSupply mobile runs on Android tablets (not on phones as there is too much data to use well on small phone screens).\nThe application requires at least Android 5.0 (Lollipop)\nMinimumRecommended\nDisplay size9.8 inches10.1 inches\nResolution768 x 1024 pixels800 x 1200 pixels\nAndroid version5.08.1\nProcessorQuad-core 1.3GHz\nMemory1.5 Gb RAM\n\nIn order to provide support, the device must also be compatible with MDM (Mobile Device Management) software and support google services. Please contact mSupply Foundation for details.\nPlease contact us for testing and / or advice before making a large hardware purchase.\nSmart UPS\nA 'smart' UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) detects when the battery power is about to run out and sends a notification to software on the server which triggers a graceful shut down of the computer. To enable this, there needs to be a cable connection (normally USB) between the UPS and the computer combined with software running on the computer.\nIn our experience, the primary cause of computer hardware failure is data corruption due to ungraceful shutdowns. This happens when power to the computer is cut instantly, without any notification to the computer to shut down gracefully. If the machine is 'protected' by a normal UPS, then this can still happen when the battery power runs out. Even if the machine is notionally protected by a 'smart' UPS, there are a number of circumstances where this UPS protection fails:\n\nCable connection and software can fail.\n\nCable becomes disconnected\nSoftware isn't configured correctly\nSoftware doesn't start up\n\n\nUPS batteries degrade (normally within 2 years of installation in environments with regular power cuts) and there is too little capacity to run long enough for the computer to shut down gracefully after receiving the notification from the UPS\n\nLaptop computers tend to be much more resilient to power failure:\n\nA laptop's built-in 'smart' UPS is very reliable\nThe internal batteries last much longer than UPS batteries\nEven if the laptop internal battery degrades, the 'smart' function appears to work much more reliably than a standalone UPS communicating with a 'tower' computer.\n\nHere are some additional advantages of laptops vs. desktop machines:\n\nLower cost of freight:\n\nTo send the machine to site\nTo send spare parts for repair on-site\nTo retrieve the machine from site for any repairs that can not be undertaken on site\n\n\nIt is standard to have features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and camera included by default and this may not be the case with desktops\n\nA concern with laptop computers is security. It is easier to steal a laptop computer from an office than it is to steal a desktop computer. For this reason, laptops are normally configured with a physical locking feature such as Kensington lock slot.\nBecause Open mSupply is dealing with lots of numbers (quantities of stock), it is highly recommended to have a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Smaller laptop computers (14“ screen or less) will not have this. Smaller laptop computers normally have an impractically small screen. It is therefore recommended to procure a laptop computer with a keyboard that includes a numeric keypad - which will necessarily entail a larger screen.\nUseful productivity accessories for laptop computers include\n\nExternal mouse (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal keyboard (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal screen\n\nBackup system\nOnce you start using Open mSupply, it is of crucial importance that you have a method of backing up your data. In a default installation, Open mSupply stores all its data in a file that rapidly becomes large. You need, therefore, to have a high capacity removable storage device. We strongly recommend the use of an external hard disk using either firewire (IEEE 1394) or USB2 to facilitate off-site storage of backups.\n\nIf not using our internet backup service, you need to be able to store backed up data off-site to prevent the risk of loss by fire, theft, etc.\n\nAntivirus\nWindows based operating systems are particularly prone to malware if precautions are not taken. We recommend the following precautions:\n\nInstall a reputable anti-virus program, including web protection if the computer has access to the internet\nDisable USB ports - refer to this site for suggested methods\n\nEnsure that access to passwords to allow exceptions to the above two measures are kept secure.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/roadmap/":{"body":"This road map will be updated about once every six weeks.\nIt only covers our immediate committed work stream.

We like Firefox, but Chrome and its myriad children will also suffice.\nEnter the web address (URL) of your mSupply server. In our case we're using https://demo-open.msupply.org - our test web site.\nAfter pressing  on your keyboard you'll be shown the login page\n\n\n\nEnter your user name and password and press  on your keyboard, or click the [Log in] button\n\nAll going well, you'll be redirected to the dashboard page.\nIf there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:\n\nTry re-typing the username and password (note that both are case-sensitive).\nWhen you log in, the default store for your user is selected as the current store. If you have access to other stores, you'll be able to change stores after logging in (see below).\nIf you have logged in previously, and changed stores, then the most recent store will be selected for you when you log in.\nNavigating around\nThe main menu is on the left side of the screen. If you have a small screen size, then it will be collapsed by default - for larger screens it will instead be open by default.\nTo open and close you can click on the logo at the top, as shown below. The menu remains either open or closed once you have selected an option.\nIf the menu is closed, simply hovering over the menu items will open it, in which case clicking on an item will let the menu close again. If you are on a tablet, clicking on a menu item will have the same effect.\n\nOn some screens you'll see that the header shows a heading, such as Outbound Shipment in the example above. Clicking on a specific shipment then changes that heading to Outbound Shipment/ #[the shipment number]. You are able to click on the Outbound Shipment part to return to the list - or use the main navigation on the left.\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThere are keyboard shortcuts used throughout open mSupply. Rather than remember them all, to get started you simply have to remember the combination control (ctrl)+k (windows and linux) or cmd (⌘)+k (mac)\nThis will bring up the following window, no matter which page you are on:\n\nThis shows you the list of globally available shortcuts, for example pressing d on your keyboard will take you to the dashboard (unless you are entering text into an input field!).\nHowever, you can also click on an item in the list, or search available commands:\n\nIn addition - there are various places where specific keyboard shortcuts are available. An example is the tab control used in both Stocktakes and Inbound Shipments. Here you can use control+1 to navigate to the first tab (Quantities) or control+2 for the second tab (Pricing) etc. If you press + on your keyboard, you can add a new batch.\n\nFooter\nThe bottom of the screen contains some useful information and is shown on every screen\n\nSome users have access to more than one store. To change the store which is currently selected, simply click on the store name in the footer:\n\nYou will see the notification and the store name in the footer will be updated. From now, all actions will be in the newly selected store.\nHelp!\nIf you get stuck at any time when using the site, click on the Docs menu item.\n\nThis will take you to the documentation page which relates to the current page you are viewing.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/","title":"Inventory"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/images/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/images/","title":"Inventory"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-takes/":{"body":"mSupply will automatically keep track of your stock levels for you, as you receive and distribute it. But sometimes data gets entered incorrectly or stock goes out without anyone making an entry in the system. \nOf course, we try not to let that happen but, if it does happen, we can make corrections. The easiest way to correct mistakes is to do a Stocktake. \nIn mSupply, you can easily do a stocktake for: \n\nA full inventory\nA limited range of items\nA single item\n\nViewing Stocktakes\nTo view your stocktakes, go to Inventory and then Stocktakes in the navigation panel: \n\nThis brings up a list of all your stocktakes: \n\nFor each stock stake you can see:\n\nThe stock take number\nThe stock take status. There are two stock take statuses: \n\nNew: a stocktake you are still working on\nFinalised: a stocktake that has alredy been performed. You can no longer edit it.\n\n\nA description of the stocktake (eg. March Stocktake)\nIf any, a comment about the stoctake\nThe date of the stock take\n\n\nThere is little point in keeping old stocktakes with status = NEW, especially if you are about to create a new stocktake containing the same items. Indeed, it can be quite dangerous to leave old stocktakes with status NEW in your system. If time has passed since the stocktake was created, then the snapshot and actual quantities are almost certainly incorrect. For good housekeeping reasons, it is good practice to delete old NEW stocktakes.\n\nCreating a new stock take\nLet's start a new stocktake. To do so, tap on the New Stocktake button in the right corner of the screen. \n\nA window appears, inviting you to select items to be counted:\n\nSelecting Items\nSelect items you wish to count using the check boxes. You can select more than one: \n\nIf you want to to include every item (or most items), check the Select All box and click on OK:\n\nUse the search bar to look for a specific item by typing its name or its code: \n\nClick on OK when you have selected all the items you would like to count. \nThe stocktake will then be created, and existing stock lines will be used to populate the values for batch, expiry, pack size and snapshot number of packs. The lines show as light blue, and will change to black when a value is entered for the counted quantity.\nYou are not able to edit the pack size of stocktake rows which are linked to an existing stock line. If you wish to repack, you can delete the row and add a new row or rows, as necessary.\n\n\nDon't worry if your forget one item. You will have the possibility to add more items to your stocktake afterwards. \n\nPrinting Stocktake sheet\nWhen viewing a specific Stocktake, simply click the Print button which is on the top right of the page.\nWhen printing, a PDF file is generated for you, which will then open in a new browser tab. This can then be printed using your browser by clicking print or using control+P (if using windows) or cmd+P keys on your keyboard (if using a mac).\n\nThis will either\n\nShow a menu of possible reports for you to select from before creating a PDF. This will happen if there are more than one report defined for the Stocktake report type.\nCreate a PDF immediately, if there is only one report to select from\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-takes/","title":"Stocktakes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-view/":{"body":"One of the most important - but easiest - tasks in mSupply is to check how much stock you have on hand.

Other relevant pages include:\n\nSetup instructions\nRecording Adverse Drug Reactions\nDashboards for Vaccination Monitoring\nWeb portal entry of Registrations and Adverse Events\n\nIntroduction\nmSupply mobile has handled dispensing since 2019, and cold chain equipment monitoring since version 7 (March 2021).\nNow it also has a specific workflow for vaccine dispensing. This differs from normal dispensing in several important ways\n\nPatient registration collects a lot more data than what is typically required for dispensing a prescription, such as\n\nHas the patient ever had Covid-19 before?\nIs the patient pregnant?\nIs the patient lactating?\nHas the patient ever had an adverse reaction to a vaccine previously?\n\n\nThe dispensing workflow is greatly simplified\n\nWhen an existing patient is chosen, the extra information fields are chosen, as many of them are time-dependent, so the current value for the field might be different from the saved value. For instance, the patient might not have been pregnant when they were recorded in the system some weeks or months ago, but they are now.\nOnly items marked as vaccines are shown, so there is no need to type in the item name- you simply choose from the list.\nThe dispensed quantity is always one, so no quantity field needs filling out.\nThe vaccine batch and VVM status are shown, and the batch used can be selected.\nIf using multi-dose vials, the batch with an open vial is chosen by default.\nYou can record that the patient refused vaccination.\nYou can record who the vaccinator was.\n\n\nAdverse Reaction Reporting is added to the system.\n\nThe adverse reaction reporting data that is collected is configurable on the server, so can vary depending on the vaccination campaign being run at the time. Further documentation is available here\n\n\n\nSetup\nSetup is technical and needs to be done carefully. We know you're careful ;-)\nHere are the instructions\nUsing the module\nOnce Setup is complete, you'll end up with an mobile navigation screen that looks like this:\n\nStep one: Patient details\n\nNote that each step has a Cancel button which will cancel the process\nYou can also press on any one of the three steps along the top of the window  after they’ve been completed to revisit that step and edit details if needed.\nSelecting a patient\n\nSearch by last name, first name and Date of birth\n\nIn the example below, we've entered the first and last name exactly, and the date of birth. Amazingly, there is only one match!\n\n\nWhen typing, we look up in your local database first. If the patient still doesn’t come up, click the Search online button, which will use the same search information you have already entered and send a request to your cloud server to see if the patient exists anywhere in your system.\n\nNOTE: Requires the internet\nIf you still can’t find the patient, click “New Patient”\nIf you do find your patient, click on the row to go to step 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively (as of v8.1.0), it is possible to lookup patients by QR Code (provided these details have been loaded into mSupply). \n\nUpon tapping the Scan QR Code button a window will appear with a camera view. \nAs soon as a QR Code is found in the viewfinder mSupply mobile will attempt to first search in your local database for a patient that matches the QR Code scanned. \nIf the patient was not found locally and there is internet available, a search will then be sent to your cloud server to see if the patient exists anywhere in your system. \nIf the patient was still not found after a search on the cloud server (or internet is not available), you will get a message indicating that no patient was found, and will arrive back at the manual entry page, where you can either enter details manually (as per above) or try another QR Code.\n\n\n\n\nStep two: Add or edit patient information\n\nAfter choosing a patient, you're shown the standard mSupply information for the patient in the left-hand panel, and any extra information that you have configured in the right-hand panel.\nStep three: Additional vaccination details\n\nNote that this third step is only available from mobile v8.1.0 onwards, and requires a form to be configured on the mSupply server for it to display. The form configuration drives the content shown in step three.\nIf using v8.0.X, or a form is not configured on the server, there will only be three steps total shown in the vaccine dispensing flow (step three will instead be dispense a vaccine. )\nStep four: Dispense a vaccine\n\nHere you can select who the vaccinator is - these will be set up on your primary server\nYou can also select which vaccine you are giving to the patient. The one which was dispensed most recently will be auto-selected for you.\nYou can also select which batch the patient received. The batch which is open and with the most recent expiry will be auto-selected for you.\nAlternatively, you can select REFUSE VACCINE which will note that the patient refused to be vaccinated\nTapping Confirm will send you back to the menu page.\nTapping OK &amp; Next will allow you to vaccinate another patient.\n\n\nRefused vaccinations\nIf the patient refuses to be vaccinated, then check the Refused vaccine checkbox at the top-right. \n\nA text field will then become available to record a reason for the refusal.\nA note will be recorded on the patient's file with the date of refusal, and the reason (if one was specified).\nAdverse Reactions\nYou can record an adverse drug reaction (ADR), or specifically in this case, an Adverse event from immunisation (AEFI).\nAs this is not restricted to vaccines, the functionality is described in a separate page here\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/vaccine-dispensing/","title":"Vaccine dispensing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/vaccine/":{"body":"This functionality is available from mSupply mobile v7.0.0 onwards\nCold Chain (for Vaccines and other Cold chain items)\nSetting up to use the Vaccine module\nVaccine mode only shows if the store is configured correctly on the server, with the preference 'mobile: Uses vaccine module' enabled.

Please contact coldchain@msupply.foundation for further information.\nAdding Sensors\nThe first time you use the Vaccine module, there will be no sensors connected to your device.\n\nTap Add Sensor to start the three-step process to add a sensor.\nPlease make sure that you have an approved mSupply temperature sensor.  Only approved sensors can be connected to mSupply Mobile. \nWe recommend you keep the sensor close when you are adding or editing it within mSupply Mobile.  Also, allow for up to a minute for any changes to be communicated via Bluetooth. \nIf you are using a brand new sensor, press the top of the sensor until it flashes to turn it on.\nStep 1: Select the correct sensor\nWhen you tap Add Sensor, your device will scan and list any sensors that can be connected by Bluetooth.\n\nIf you tap the BLINK button, the LED light for that sensor will flash.  You can use this to make sure that you are connecting the correct sensor. \nWhen you are sure that you have the correct sensor, tap Connect for that sensor.\nStep 2: Sensor Thresholds\nFirstly, some definitions:\n\nConsecutive means a single event where the temperature stays over (or under) the threshold for the whole time. So if you have a threshold of 8 degrees, and a consecutive breach time of 10 minutes, then a breach that lasts for 6 minutes, then drops under the threshold for 2 minutes, then breaches again for 6 minutes is not a consecutive breach, but the 2 x 6 minute breaches are added to the cumulative breach records.\nCumulative means adding together the total time over a certain temperature for a series of breaches.\n\nNow we can set the temperature breach conditions for the sensor.  There are four thresholds that you can define:\n\n\nHot Consecutive\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature above this value for longer than the specified time. Using the +/- buttons, select the maximum temperature and minimum duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nCold Consecutive\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature below this value for longer than the specified time. Using the +/- buttons, select the minimum temperature and minimum duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nHot Cumulative\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature above this value for longer than the total specified time specified (total time is calculated as the sum of all breach times). Using the +/- buttons, select the maximum temperature and minimum total duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\nCold Cumulative\n\nA breach will be displayed when the sensor logs a temperature below this value for longer than the total specified time specified (total time is calculated as the sum of all breach times). Using the +/- buttons, select the minimum temperature and minimum total duration required to identify the breach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to long press the +/- buttons to change the values faster.\n\nTap Back if you wish to return to Step 1 and check that you have the correct sensor.\nTap Next to move to Step 3.\nTap Cancel if you no longer want to add the sensor.\nStep 3: Sensor connection\nIn this final step you need to enter:\n*Sensor Name: enter a new name for the sensor. This is the name which will appear within mSupply mobile. You should choose a name to make it easy to identify the sensor.\n*Sensor Code: enter a short name code for the sensor. You should choose a code that is unique for each sensor.\n\nFor reporting purposes, we recommend that you do not use special characters such as “-, +, *” etc in either the Sensor Name or Sensor Code fields. \n\n*Logging Interval: using the +/- buttons, select the length of time between temperature logs.  You can set the logging interval to any length between 1 and 30 minutes. The default logging interval is 5 minutes.\n*Start Logging: Use the +/- buttons to select the delay in minutes from now of the first temperature log. The sensor can be configured to start a maximum of 30 days from the current date.\nWhen setting the schedule for the first temperature log, allow sufficient time for the sensor to be placed in its desired location and adjust to the location’s temperature. 20 minutes should be sufficient in most situations.\n\nTap Connect to complete sensor setup and add the sensor to mSupply mobile.  This will return you to the mSupply mobile vaccine home screen and you will see the sensor has been added.\nTap Back if you wish to return to Step 2 and edit the sensor thresholds (temperature breach conditions).\nTap Cancel if you no longer want to add the sensor.\n\n\nWe recommend that each device should be linked to a maximum of six sensors. Each sensor should only be linked to one device. \n\nEdit Sensor\nTo edit sensor details, you can tap on the ‘’cog’’ icon on the mSupply Vaccine home page (above screenshot) or on the Sensor Detail screen.\nScreenshot\nAll sensor threshold and sensor connection details are editable except for the start Logging date and time.  Simply tap on the field that you wish to end and make changes.\n\nNo changes will be made until you tap Save.\n\nDepending on your proximity to the sensor and the Bluetooth capabilities of your device, changes can take a few minutes.\n\nPausing Sensor Downloads\nThe edit screen also allows you to Pause temperature logging by the sensor.  When a sensor has been paused, it will appear in the title line both on the mSupply mobile vaccine home screen as well as the Sensor Detail screen.\n\nReplacing a Sensor\nTapping Replace will open up the scanner and allow you to choose from list of alternative sensors.  The list will only show sensors that are not currently connected to your device.\n\nFrom the list, select the replacement sensor.  You can press Blink to check that you have the correct sensor (the LED light will flash for this sensor).\nDeleting a Sensor\nTap Remove to remove any sensor no longer being used. You will receive a prompt to confirm the deletion.\n\nUsing the Vaccine module\nEnabling the Vaccine module will change the look of your menu page, adding an extra Vaccines button. \n\nSupplier Invoices\nWith vaccine module enabled you automatically get a few extra columns on a supplier invoice for vaccines - the Location and Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM) status columns.\n\nYou can select a location by tapping on the arrow icon in the Location cell. This will allow you to choose a location from a list. \n\nYou can also change the Vaccine vial monitor status for items that have been defined as vaccines on the cloud server - this defaults to the lowest level, but can be edited by clicking on the arrow icon in the VVM Status column.\n\nCustomer Invoices\nVaccine module automatically adds two extra columns on a customer invoice - the Doses and Breach columns. \n\n\nThe Doses column is for the number of doses actually used (so we can account for open-vial wastage). It will automatically get populated by the item quantity * number of doses in a vial, for convenience, but you can also edit it! There is a maximum limit of the number of doses in a vial for that vaccine * the quantity, though.\nThe Breach column shows when a vaccine item has been in a temperature breach. Note that without entering a quantity into the customer invoice for the item, we don’t know exactly what batches are being issued, so the breach icon may not show up yet.\nIf the breach icon (an orange triangle with an exclamation) does show for a row, this signals that the stock line has had a temperature breach. Tapping the icon will bring up a graph of the temperature breach. In the example below, the fridge seems to be broken, probably not a good idea to use this batch!\n\n\nSupplier Requisitions\nTapping on a row in your supplier requisition will show you the date of the last requisition for your vaccine, as well as other details such as the open and closed vial wastage since the last requisition. \n\nStocktakes\nTapping on a stocktake row for a vaccine item will also show the additional columns for Doses and Breach. \n\nHere, you can adjust the quantities of your vaccine if needed, change the location, or if the vaccine vial monitor status has changed, you can update that here. You can also view the breaches the batch has been in to help you make decisions!\nVaccine home page\nTapping on the Vaccines button in the menu page will bring you to a list of all the temperature sensors connected to your device and an overview of current status and actions for each sensor.\n\nThe sensor header displays the following information:\n*Circle: a green circle indicates that the sensor is currently within the specified temperature range and the sensor battery is equal or above 25%. A red circle indicates that the sensor is currently outsides the specified temperature range or the sensor battery is below 25%.\n*Sensor Name:  as configured during sensor connection.\n*WiFi Icon and last log time: the time of the last temperature download occurred.  The time will flash when download is currently in process.\n*Battery Icon: a percentage figure and icon showing remaining battery charge for the sensor.\n*Down Arrow Icon: Tap to export sensor data (temperature logs and breaches) to csv format and send via email data.\n*Light Bulb Icon: Tap to make the sensor LED light flash/blink.\n*Cog Button: Tap if you wish to edit the sensor configuration.\nThe row under the sensor header displays the following information:\n*Sensor’s MAC address\n*Thermometer icon and last recorded temperature\n*Clock Icon and the time of the last temperature breach (if applicable)\nTap anywhere on a sensor box to view further details.\nSensor Detail\n\nTap on the date range on the top left of the screen to change the time (and data) displayed.\nThe header information is as above.\nTemperature Graph\nThe red line represents the hot consecutive threshold.  The blue line represents the cold consecutive threshold. (You can set these here).  Any temperature logs outside of the lines (breaches) will be indicated with the exclamation icon.\nThe last temperature logged will display to the right of the graph.  The sensor status rectangle (surrounding the last temperature log) will be:\n*red for a hot breach.\n*blue for a cold breach.\nTemperature Cards\nUnderneath the graph are five temperature cards:\n\nCold Cumulative Breach: the length of the breach \nCold Consecutive Breach: the number of breaches\nAverage temperature: calculated over the date range selected in degrees Centigrade\nHot Cumulative Breach: the length of the breach\nHot Consecutive Breach: the number of breaches\n\nExporting Sensor Data\nIt is possible to download the temperature (breach) logs and sensor settings by clicking the ‘Download’ button in the header (on either the Vaccine home page or the Sensor Details page).\n\nThe Download screen requires:\n*Email address\n*Comment\nTapping Download will open a new email in your device’s email application.  The receiver address and comment will be prepopulated, and the sensor data (in CSV format) attached, ready to send.\n\n\nIf you change your mind about emailing the data, tap anywhere in the grayed-out area.\n|  Previous:  The Cash Register | | Next:  Mobile Settings\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/vaccine/","title":"Vaccines"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/web-apps/":{"body":"Both the patient registration and adverse reaction monitoring features in mSupply mobile are also available via a web site.\nPatient registrations entered on the web site is immediately available to all sites using the patient lookup feature of mSupply mobile.\nThe front page looks like this:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/dispensing_vaccines/web-apps/","title":"Vaccines/ADR Web Portal "},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/","title":"mSupply mobile"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/getting-started/":{"body":"Android device hardware requirements\nGoogle Mobile Services (GMS)\n\nThere is a good chance that if your proposed device is not on this list of supported models, then it will not support Google Mobile Services (GMS), mSupply Mobile and/or the mobile device management software used to remotely manage the device.\nEven if it is on this list, please make sure the model has been validated by Sustainable Solutions before procuring any significant quantities of the device.

It may be worth procuring devices that are mobile data enabled (3G minimum), at least to allow future flexibility.  But that doesn't answer the harder questions:\n\nWho is responsible for keeping the device connected?\nWho pays for it?\nWhat happens when the bill isn't paid?\nWhat happens when a generous data cap is exceeded and the internet connection is down?  (Somebody may have removed the SIM from the device and placed it in another device…)\n\n\nMost officers in charge of an mSupply Mobile device are capable of keeping their personal cellular mobile device connected to the internet, at least occasionally, which is all that mSupply Mobile needs.  An officer could be happy to receive a nominal monthly fee to [tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) the mSupply Mobile device to their personal cellular device hotspot and data.  This fee might only be payable if the officer meets certain pre-agreed KPIs such as:\n\n\nEnsuring device has connecting to the internet at least, say, once per week,\nConducting stocktakes\nPlacing internal orders\nProcessing supplier invoices\nOther(s)\n\nOf course, such an arrangement would still require management.\nConfiguration on the mSupply Server\nBefore using mSupply Mobile, the mSupply central server needs to be configured for it - refer to the mSupply User Guide for details.\n\nIf you are upgrading an existing mSupply Mobile device to version 2.0.0, there are a few changes that need to be made to your mSupply Desktop/Server:\n\nUpgrade to mSupply Server v3.83 or higher\nSet Visibility for Supplying Stores (including main Supplying Store)\nAdd a new Supplier as facility (External Supplier) and make it visible in mobile store\nSet all other mobile/desktop stores that current mobile store needs to interact with (send/receive Requisition, send/receive Invoices) as 'transfers' in store/synchroniser (this needs to be done by your mSupply team)\n\n\nInstallation\nYou can download the latest version of mSupply Mobile from GitHub here\nConnecting to the central server\nAfter mSupply Mobile is installed on your tablet and you've started it, you need to enter the 'site' credentials (user name and password) and the URL for the mSupply server that will hold the data will be generated by the tablet.\n\nBe careful to enter the correct credentials here.  If you fail to enter it three times in a row, you will be locked out from trying again for 1 hour!\nAndroid auto-correct may try to add a space after each word.  This will result in incorrect credentials being entered.\n\nLogging in\nAfter the device has synced to the central server you will see the login screen:\n\nSelecting the language\n\nThe first thing to do is to choose your preferred language by clicking Language at the bottom left of the screen. For example, if your first language is Tetum, then you're in luck! - see below.\n\n\nLogging in the user\n\nUsers need to be configured on the mSupply central server - refer to Setting up the Users to access the store.\n\nOnce you have selected the language of your choice, enter the credentials (user name and password) for the store user and tap \nLogin\n\n\nBe careful to enter the correct credentials here.

We will be returning to the main screen a lot as we use mSupply Mobile, so it's important to understand the main functions. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nIcon badges\nIcon badges (orange circle with a number) indicate there are unfinalised transactions requiring attention. Click a badge for a description. Badges will automatically disappear when there are no unfinalised transactions remaining.\n\nSync\n\nmSupply Mobile will attempt to sync to the Primary server at regular intervals.\nThe default sync interval is 10 minutes.\nThe interval between these attempts (the sync interval) can be configured to be from 1 minute to 10 minutes by Editing the Sync Interval.\n\nA link on the top right of the screen shows the Sync Status.\n\nClicking this link will take you to a page where you can choose to do a manual sync if you want to re-sync in-between the automatic syncs.\n\nYou can close this page by clicking the cross on the top right.\nSettings\nUsers with the appropriate permissions can access the mobile Settings on the bottom right of the screen.\n\nLogging out\nTo log out, click the Log Out button on the bottom left of the screen.\n\nCustomers\nThe Customers area is for all the stock that goes OUT of your facility. Customers can be other facilities you supply, doctors and nurses doing outreach tours, or individual patients.\nThe Customer Invoices button shows a list of orders sent TO your customers and allows you to create new ones.\nThe Customer Requisitions button shows a list of orders placed BY customers requesting stock from your store. \nSuppliers\nThe Suppliers area shows orders that you have placed and received for your own stock. Usually, you will only have ONE supplier (a medical store or other healthcare facility) and this will be pre-programmed for you. \nThe Supplier Invoices button shows a list of orders you have received or are waiting to receive.\nThe Supplier Requisitions button allows you to place an order and shows a list of orders you have already placed.\nStock\nThe Stock section is used to manage the stock in your store. \nThe Current Stock button allows you to easily see how much stock you have on hand (\"How many paracetamol tablets do I have?\"), search for an individual item, or check expiry dates. \nThe Stocktakes button allows you to do a stocktake on all items or a small selection of items and shows you a list of all previous stocktakes. You can also use this area to update the stock levels of an item when you realise there is a mistake.\nTetum\nAnd here is the main screen in Tetum language !\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/images/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/images/","title":"Catalogue"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/introduction/introduction/":{"body":"The original mSupply mobile docs are here\nWe are slowly transferring documentation (and updating it) over to this web site.\nSetting up mSupply Mobile on the device\n\nmSupply Mobile can be set up on your Android device by the mSupply Support Team or by your internal IT team with our support\n\nChoosing a device\nPreparing the device\nPreparing the device for mSupply is very dependant on factors including:\n\nThe make of the device\nThe version of Android running on it\nThe details of how the organisation plans to manage devices and communicate with users\n\nPlease consult with the mSupply Foundation support team ( support@msupply.org.nz ) on this. \nPlease note\n\nA device is typically allocated to a facility, NOT an individual user.

This way, if a person leaves and another person takes over operation of the device, and nothing should need to be changed.\nEach device running mSupply Mobile will correspond to one mSupply Store.\n\nInitialising the store\nAfter installing the mSupply Mobile app, you must initialise the data for the mSupply Store that the device is going to be used in. Most of the work is actually done by mSupply but you will need to set the store credentials on the device.\nWhen first syncing the new device the amount of records to sync may be large (say around 50,000). This could take hours to sync, especially over a poor internet connection. For this reason it is possible for you to limit how many months of transactions and stocktakes you want to include. Limiting the sync date range below explains how to limit the sync date range if this is required.\nWhen you open mSupply Mobile, the first screen looks as follows:\n\n\nPRIMARY SERVER URL: Please enter the correct URL for your mSupply Server, this uses HTTPS protocol for security.

If you want to keep working on an In Progress stocktake, double click on it.\nIn Progress stocktakes\nIn Progress stocktakes are the stocktakes you are still working on and haven't finalised. \nWe strongly recommend only having one In Progress stocktake at any time. This will prevent mistakes when moving between them.\nFinalise or delete old stocktakes before starting new ones!\n\n\nLet's start a new stocktake now…\nClick on New Stocktake\n\nSelect the items you wish to count\n\nIf you want to include every item or most items, select All Items Selected.\n\nTo hide items with 0 stock, select the Hide Stockouts toggle.\n\nGive your stocktake a logical name\nFor example, 'April Full Stocktake'.\nThen click Create. \n\nThis will bring up the Stocktake Editor\nThis lists each item (including Item Code, Item Name and Unit as set up in mSupply Desktop), its Snapshot Quantity and its Actual Quantity (from the physical count). \nThe Snapshot Quantity is what the system THINKS you have. If it is correct (when compared with your physical count), you don't need to do anything!\nThe Actual Quantity is what you have actually counted. You can change this by clicking in that column and typing in the correct quantity.\nNote that Quantity in mSupply mobile currently refers to the actual quantity of an item (i.e. the number of units) and not the number of packs.\nFor each item, compare your physical count with the Snapshot Quantity\nUpdate incorrect item quantities by clicking in the Actual Quantity column.\nIf you change the amount of stock you have in the Actual Quantity column, this variation will now show in in the Difference column. \nThis can take some time but remember - if the Snapshot Quantity is correct, you don't need to do anything! \n\nIf prompted, enter a reason for inventory adjustments\nIf your stocktake screen shows a Reason column, you must enter a reason for any positive or negative inventory adjustments.\nAs of v5.0.0 of mSupply mobile, the reason column is only displayed for stocktake batches and will not appear on the stocktake screen.\n\nOptions must be enabled for Stocktake Line Adjustments on the mSupply desktop server and synced to mSupply Mobile to enable reasons for inventory adjustments. \n\nIf the Actual Quantity entered is different from the Snapshot Quantity, you will be prompted to select a Reason for the Difference from a standard list. You will not be able to continue until a reason is selected.\n\n\nTo change the reason, click on the cell again.\nEdit batch-specific information\nYou can adjust batch-specific information or add new batches by clicking the item's Batches icon. \n\nIn this example there is only one batch of paracetamol. \n\nIf there are multiple batches:\n\nInventory adjustments will be automatically made to the batch that arrived first (i.e. first in - first out).\n\nIn this example there are three batches of ibuprofen. The Snapshot Quantity was 300 and the Actual Quantity was 220. The Difference of 80 was automatically taken away from the batch that arrived first. However, this can be manually changed in this screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inventory adjustment reason selected will automatically apply to all batches. \n\nHowever, separate reasons for different batches can be manually changed in this screen.

The order will send automatically once your device is able to connect to the internet.\n\nRemember:\nA Supplier Requisition is an order that you have placed with your supplier. \nA Supplier Invoice is a record of what your supplier has actually sent you.\nThese are not always the same, as your supplier might not have enough stock to fill your requisition, or they might have sent you some extra stock. When stock arrives at your facility, you should check it off against the Supplier Invoice. \n\nThis chapter tells you how to receive stock.\n|  *  Previous:  Ordering and Receiving stock from suppliers | | Next: Supplier Requisitions (Program Orders) *\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/order_and_receive/supplier-requisitions/","title":"Supplier Requisitions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/","title":"Settings and Set-up"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/images/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/images/","title":"Catalogue"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mobile/setup/mobile-settings/":{"body":"The Mobile Settings is where a user with appropriate permissions can carry out certain administration tasks including:\n\nEdit the Sync URL and Sync Password for your mobile store.\nConfigure the Sync interval and Idle logout interval.\nView the Realm Explorer\nExport Data (i.e. export your database file).\nImport Data (i.e. import a database file from another device).\nPerform a Factory Reset (i.e. remove all app-related data, including sync settings from the device)\nCheck Connection (verifies connectivity between mSupply mobile and mSupply Desktop)\n\nPermission to Edit Mobile Settings\nTo edit mobile settings, the user must have the View/Edit Preferences permission set for the mobile store on the Central server - please see the  5.
