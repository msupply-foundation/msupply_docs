Tab)\n\n\nExample: For the item *030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs*, there are 3527 tabs available. \n\n\nIssue [Quantity] of units in packs of [Pack Size]🔗\nIn the Issue Quantity field, you can enter the quantity that you want to issue to your customer. \nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units. However, you have the possibility to issue a quantity of packs instead by changing the value in the second dropdown (Pack Size). \nDefault value is Any when you are issuing units. \n\nList of available batches:🔗\nThis is a list of batch numbers that you have in store for this item: \n\n# Packs: Number of packs to be issued\nPack Size: Quantity of units per pack\nUnit Qty: Total quantity of units to be issued\nAvailable: Number of packs available (not already allocated to other shipments)\nIn store: Total number of packs in your store\nBatch: Batch number. It is a designation given to products made in the same manufacturing run. \nExpiry: Expiry date of the batch (format: MM/YYYY)\nLocation: If you inventory is managed with storage locations, the name of the location where the item is stored\nSell: Selling unit price of the item\nOn Hold: Indicate whether a batch is on hold or not. You cannot issue a batch that is on hold. \nPlaceholder: The placeholder line is used when the quantity you are issuing is higher than your available stock\n\n\nIssue a quantity of units🔗\nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units, regardless of the pack size (number of units in a pack). \nWhen entering a number in the Issue Quantity field, system automatically chooses the batch number(s) with the shortest expiry date (First to Expire, First Out or FEFO logic). \n\nIn below example, we are issuing 100 units of the item. All 100 units will be taken from the same batch (second row). First batch was not selected because it is expired. \n\n\n\nIn this other example, we are issuing 1200 units. System selects two batches with different pack sizes. \n\n\nNote that in this list, the batches which are available for selection are shown first and batches which are not (on hold or no stock available) are shown below and in a grey font.\nIssue a quantity of packs🔗\nYou can decide to issue a quantity of packs. To do this, you can change the value in the Pack Size dropdown. \n\nLet's imagine that your customer only wants pack size of 12 units. You can change the dropdown value from `Any` to `12`. \n\n\nYou are now offered to issue a number of packs of 12 units. Only batch number(s) with a pack size of 12 units can be automatically issued.\n\nIn below example, we are issuing 10 packs of 12 units:\n\n\n\n if you had previously entered a quantity of units and you switch to a quantity a packs, the quantity of units will automatically be converted into the correct quantity of packs.  \n\n\nWhen a pack size is selected, and stock lines which have a different pack size are not available for selection. As such, those rows are listed lower down in the table and are shown in a grey font, in the same way as other unavailable rows.\nManual Allocation🔗\nRegardless if you chose to issue a quantity of units or packs, you can always manually change the quantity at the batch number level directly before pressing on OK. \nYou simply have to enter or edit the quantity in the # Packs column. \nThe main Issue Quantity field will be automatically updated with the new quantity.\n\n  when allocating quantities at the batch number level, the quantity you enter is always a quantity of packs. \n\n\n\nManual allocation at the batch number level.\n\nIssuing when there is not enough stock (Placeholder Line)🔗\nIf the amount to be issued is greater than the total stock available from all of the available lines, then the quantity to be issued will automatically be placed in the placeholder field, at the bottom of the list of available batch numbers. \nPlaceholder lines can be allocated later when new stock arrives. However, all shipment lines must be allocated before confirming the allocation. \n\nSince there is no stock available for 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml, system is issuing a 100 units in the placeholder field. \n\n\nWhen you look at an Outbound Shipment, you can see if a shipment line has not been allocated or has been partially allocated when it is higlighted in blue. \n\nConfirm Item and Quantity🔗\nWhen you are happy with the quantity, you can either press on:\n\nthe OK button. You are redirected to the Outbound Shipment view and your item has been added to the list. \nthe OK &amp; Next button to add another item right away\nthe Cancel if you do not want to add the item to the Outbound Shipment anymore\n\nEditing an Outbound Shipment Line🔗\nTo edit an shipment line, tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen. \nEdit a Shipment Line🔗\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status lower than Shipped. \n\n\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit. \n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line🔗\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit.\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list. \nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs\n\n\n\n  You can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nProcessing an Outbound Shipment🔗\nAllocating an Outbound Shipment🔗\nAllocation is the process of assigning one or multiple batch numbers from the inventory to a shipment line. In other words, you are assigning stock to your shipment. Once allocated, the stock is reserved for the shipment and thus for your customer. \nThere are 2 main ways to allocate a shipment line: \n\n\nWhen adding items, system is automatically assigning stock to the new shipment line when you enter a quantity. If you don't have enough stock, system will add placeholder lines (unallocated lines). \n\n\nBulk action Allocate placeholder lines: \n\nSelect the lines that you want to allocate by checking boxes on the right on the list\nIn the Actions dropdown menu, select Allocate placeholder lines. System will check if there is available stock for each selected lines and allocate them using the First to Expire, First Out (FEFO) logic. A notification will let you know whether the operation is successful or not. \n\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to process your Outbound Shipment if you have unallocated lines (shipment lines without batch number(s) assigned to it). You can wait for more stock to arrive or you can delete the placeholder lines. \n\nConfirming an Outbound Shipment's allocation🔗\nOnce you all your shipments lines have been allocated, you can confirm the allocation:\n\nCurrent status of the shipment has to be NEW\nLines must be assigned with one or several batch numbers. You won't be able to confirm the allocation if your shipment contains lines without batch numbers assigned to it (placeholder lines). \n\nTo confirm the allocation, press the Confirm Allocated button. \n\nOnce the allocation is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is ALLOCATED\nYou are now invited to confirm the picking via the Confirm Picked button\nAll the items and their quantities will be reserved, meaning that they are no longer available for allocation\nYou can print a pick slip to be sent to your warehouse so they can start preparing the shipment\n\nConfirming Outbound Shipment picking🔗\nPicking refers to the process where individual items are picked from a fulfillment facility (usually a warehouse or a pharmacy store).\nOnce a shipment has been allocated, next step is to go get the items to prepare the actual shipment. To help with that, you are able to generate a pick slip document. A pickslip indicates:\n\nWhat are the items to be picked\nThe quantity and batch numbers for each item\nIf you manage your inventory with storage locations, where the items are located\n\nOnce all items are picked and packed. You can then confirm the picking of the shipment to indicate to indicate that it is ready to be dispatched. \nTo confirm that a shipment has been picked, tap on the Confirm Picked button. \n\nOnce picking is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now PICKED\nYou are now invited to confirm the shipping via the Confirm Shipped button\nAn Inbound Shipment has been generated and is now visible to your customer\n\nAt this stage, you are still able to edit shipment lines, to add items or to delete existing lines. However, if picking has been confirmed, you need to make sure to inform your fulfillment facility of any change so they can make sure that the shipment is still correct. \nConfirming the Outbound Shipment shipping🔗\nThe last step to issue stock with an Outbound Shipment is to confirm that stock has been shipped. This a critical step cause when goods are confirmed as shipped, they are no longer part of your inventory records. \nTo confirm that an Outbound Shipment has been shipped, tap on the Confirm Shipped button. \nOnce shipping has been confirmed: \n\nShipment status is now SHIPPED\nGoods are  no longer part of your inventory\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\nYou can print a delivery note or an invoice\n\nTracking Progress of Outbound Shipments🔗\nIf your customer is also using mSupply, you wil be able to see when they'll receive your shipments:\n\nstatus will become DELIVERED when goods are received: your customer confirmed that they received your goods\nstatus will become VERIFIED when shipment has been verified by your customer. Goods are now part of their inventory\n\nViewing an Outbound Shipment🔗\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows.

Open mSupply est conçu pour fonctionner en priorité en mode hors ligne, ce qui signifie que les utilisateurs peuvent continuer à effectuer leurs opérations quotidiennes sans avoir besoin d'une connexion Internet. Une connexion Internet occasionnelle est nécessaire pour synchroniser les données des sites distants vers le serveur central. \nQuelles sont les limites de traitement des données ?🔗\nCette question comporte trois aspects avec Open mSupply :\n\nSites Distants: ce sont les endroits où vous effectuez vos tâches quotidiennes.\nSites distants hébergés dans le cloud: ils peuvent être utilisés lorsque vous disposez d'un accès Internet permanent de haute qualité.\nServeur central : c'est là où les données principales sont gérées et où toutes les données des sites distants sont agrégées pour la création de rapports.\n\nSites Distants🔗\nSur un site distant particulier, la base de données sera SQLite si vous utilisez Android, ou généralement Postgres si vous utilisez un serveur de bureau. Nous partons du principe que si vous avez un site très actif, vous passerez à un ordinateur de bureau (ce qui est un processus facile), de sorte que les limites d'Android sont moins pertinentes.\nType d'enregistrementLimite d'enregistrement\nProduits&gt; 1,000,000\nArticles gérés&gt; 1,000,000,000\nUtilisateursconfiguration centralisée - pas de limite par site\nFournisseursconfiguration centralisée - pas de limite par site\nTransactions&gt; 1,000,000,000\n\nSites distants hébergés dans le cloud🔗\nSi vous hébergez votre site distant dans le cloud, il peut avoir des milliers d'utilisateurs connectés. Les limites d'enregistrement sont les mêmes que celles mentionnées précédemment, mais les performances seront déterminées par la bande passante disponible, à la fois pour le serveur et pour la connexion Internet de chaque utilisateur.\nServeur central🔗\nLe serveur central utilise Postgres et agrège toutes les données de tous les sites. Il agit également comme serveur de données principal pour les sites, les produits (articles), les installations, les fournisseurs et les utilisateurs.\nType d'enregistrementLimite d'enregistrement\nProduits&gt; 1,000,000\nArticles gérés&gt; 1,000,000,000\nUtilisateurs&gt; 100,000\nFournisseurs&gt; 100,000\nSites&gt; 100,000\nTransactions&gt; 1,000,000,000\n\nNote importante : En 2023, nous sommes toujours en train de réécrire le serveur central en tant que projet open source. Les limites du serveur central commercial mSupply sont plus basses, mais nous avons toujours des sites avec des dizaines de millions de transactions, et ce chiffre ne cesse d'augmenter. Nous ne prévoyons pas qu'un site atteigne ses limites avant la transition vers un serveur central open source.\nPeut-on avoir plusieurs utilisateurs sur une tablette Android avec Open mSupply ?🔗\nOui ! Plusieurs utilisateurs peuvent se connecter sur la même tablette.\nPeut-on avoir plusieurs dépôts sur une tablette avec Open mSupply ?🔗\nOui ! Les dépôts visibles sur chaque tablette de chaque site sont configurés de manière centralisée. Lorsque vous vous connectez, vous verrez tous les dépôts auxquels vous avez l'autorisation d'accéder. Si vous ne voyez pas un dépôt que vous attendez, vérifiez les permissions sur le serveur central et assurez-vous que le site distant s'est synchronisé après la mise à jour des permissions.\nPlusieurs utilisateurs sur plusieurs tablettes Open mSupply peuvent-ils accéder simultanément au même magasin ?🔗\nOui ! Vous pouvez également accéder à un serveur Open mSupply fonctionnant sur une tablette Android depuis un appareil exécutant Open mSupply Desktop ou depuis un navigateur Web sur n'importe quel appareil.\nDe plus, Open mSupply \"publie\" sa disponibilité sur le réseau local, ce qui vous permet de vous connecter au serveur sans vous soucier des adresses IP et autres.\nPlusieurs personnes peuvent-elles consulter/modifier simultanément le même envoi/inventaire/demande de stock ?🔗\nOui ! Cependant, la dernière modification remplacera les modifications précédentes si vous modifiez tous les deux la même ligne en même temps. L'intégrité du stock sera toutefois maintenue.\nExiste-t-il des restrictions sur les licences simultanées ?🔗\nIl n'y a aucune restriction sur le nombre d'utilisateurs connectés à un serveur.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/fr/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Foire Aux Questions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/fr/docs/introduction/introduction/":{"body":"Historique🔗\nOpen mSupply s'appuie sur plus de 20 années d'expérience de mSupply, au cours desquelles il est devenu le système d'information de gestion logistique (SIGL) le plus utilisé dans les pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire.\nOpen mSupply en bref🔗\nOpen mSupply gère votre inventaire, génère votre commande, enregistre chaque réception et sortie de produits, et fournit ainsi un solde courant actualisé de votre stock disponible pour chaque produit.\nOpen mSupply fait bien plus que cela.

Veuillez contacter l'équipe support pour bénéficier d'une assistance, si vous ne savez pas comment renseigner cette information.\nPour exécuter Open mSupply, vous aurez besoin d'un serveur mSupply qui fonctionnera comme un serveur central. Bien que nous prévoyons de créer un nouveau serveur central open source, celui-ci n'est pas encore disponible.\nVeuillez noter que nous sommes également en train de tester le processus de migration et l'intégration d'Open mSupply avec un système mSupply existant. Par conséquent, nous vous déconseillons de procéder à la mise à niveau sans nous en parler au préalable.\nInstallation\nConditions préalables\nVous avez besoin d'un système mSupply existant avec un serveur Legacy mSupply doté de modules de serveur Web et de synchronisation.\nDepuis décembre 2023, il n'est pas possible de migrer un dépôt Legacy (ou Mobile) mSupply existant vers un dépôt Open mSupply ; seuls les nouveaux dépôts peuvent être créés dans Open mSupply.\nProcédure\n1.Création de dépôts Open mSupply\nLes dépôts Open mSupply doivent être créés dans le serveur central Legacy mSupply comme détaillé dans la section Création de nouveaux dépôts.

Il peut fonctionner sur les systèmes d'exploitation Windows, Mac ou Linux.\nConfiguration matérielle requise🔗\nRecommandations générales relatives au matériel🔗\n\n\nDans les environnements où les coupures de courant sont fréquentes, il est recommandé de se procurer des ordinateurs portables plutôt que des ordinateurs de bureau. Les ordinateurs portables seront presque toujours la meilleure solution en termes de coût et d'efficacité pour les raisons suivantes :\n\nDans les environnements où l'alimentation électrique est de mauvaise qualité, les ordinateurs portables sont généralement plus fiables que les ordinateurs de bureau avec protection par onduleur (UPS). Dans de tels environnements, les batteries d'UPS tombent en panne en général sous 2 ans. Les batteries d'ordinateur portable ont une meilleure gestion de l'énergie et durent plus longtemps.\nMême lorsque la batterie d'un ordinateur portable est épuisée, la gestion de l'alimentation provoque normalement l'arrêt de la machine en douceur.\nLes ordinateurs portables ont un microphone et une caméra intégrés pour la prise en charge technique.\nLes ordinateurs portables ont un adaptateur Wi-Fi intégré pour la connexion réseau.\nLes ordinateurs portables sont plus petits et plus légers que les ordinateurs de bureau, et donc moins coûteux à expédier.\n\n\n\nUne imprimante connectée n'est pas absolument nécessaire dans toutes les situations, mais elle l'est dans la plupart des cas. Une imprimante à jet d'encre ou laser est préférable.\n\n\nAchetez du matériel pour lequel un bon service après-vente est disponible.\n\n\nAchetez des marques réputées pour leur qualité, même si cela signifie acheter une machine plus lente/ancienne.\n\n\nConfiguration requise pour Windows, Mac et Linux🔗\nLa configuration matérielle requise varie considérablement en fonction de l'utilisation prévue d'Open mSupply. Voici un guide informatif (en Anglais):\nMachineTechnical MinimumRecommended\nWindows Client machine for use with server64 bit processorWindows 104 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorWindows 108 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nMac Client machine for use with server64 bit processormacOS Mojave (10.14) – macOS Big Sur (11)(Latest release of major version is required, such as 10.14.6)4 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorMac OS 10.14.6 or later8 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nWindows server64 bit processorWindows 10 Pro or Win server 20198 Gb RAM50 GB HDD/SDD volume with daily backups to an external volume64 bit processorWindows Server 2019+8 Gb RAM4 x HDD/SDD volumes, 3 configured as RAID1 or RAID5 with hot spareDaily backups to the fourth volume plus daily off-site backupsAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\nLinux client or server64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar4 Gb RAM256 Gb storage64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar8 Gb RAM256 Gb storage\nAndroid client or server64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage\n\n\nL'enregistrement des transactions de stocks est une activité centrale d'Open mSupply. La plupart des données sur les transactions de stocks sont numériques. Un clavier numérique est utile pour les machines sur lesquelles on saisit beaucoup de données..\n\nConfiguration requise pour mobile/tablette🔗\nConnexion à un serveur Open mSupply🔗\nVous pouvez utiliser un navigateur sur une tablette pour vous connecter à un serveur Open mSupply.\nLa seule exigence est une tablette suffisamment rapide dotée d'un navigateur tel que Chrome ou Firefox.\nSolution hors ligne autonome🔗\nUne application mobile est également disponible pour les appareils Android pour une solution hors ligne autonome.\nSpécifications recommandées🔗\nEn résumé, Open mSupply mobile fonctionne sur les tablettes Android (pas sur les téléphones car les écrans de téléphone sont trop petits pour une utilisation efficace avec une grande quantité de données).\nL'application nécessite au moins Android 5.0 (Lollipop).\nMinimumRecommandé\nDisplay size9.8 inches10.1 inches\nResolution768 x 1024 pixels800 x 1200 pixels\nAndroid version5.08.1\nProcessorQuad-core 1.3GHz\nMemory1.5 Gb RAM\n\nPour que nous puissions fournir une assistance, l'appareil doit également être compatible avec le logiciel de gestion des appareils mobiles (MDM) et prendre en charge les services Google. Veuillez contacter la fondation mSupply pour plus de détails.\nN'hésitez pas à nous contacter pour des tests et/ou des conseils avant de faire un achat important de matériel.\nOnduleur Intelligent (Smart UPS)🔗\nUn onduleur intelligent (UPS)(Uninterruptible Power Supply) détecte quand une batterie est sur le point de mourir et envoie une notification à un logiciel sur le serveur, ce qui déclenche un arrêt ordonné de l'ordinateur. Pour ce faire, il faut une connexion par câble (généralement USB) entre l'onduleur et l'ordinateur, combinée à un logiciel fonctionnant sur l'ordinateur.\nSelon notre expérience, la principale cause de défaillance matérielle des ordinateurs est la corruption des données due à des arrêts brutaux. Cela se produit lorsque l'alimentation de l'ordinateur est coupée instantanément, sans aucun avertissement permettant à l'ordinateur de s'arrêter correctement. Si la machine est \"protégée\" par un onduleur normal, cela peut toujours se produire lorsque la batterie est épuisée. Même si la machine est théoriquement protégée par un onduleur intelligent, il existe un certain nombre de circonstances où cette protection peut échouer :\n\nLa connexion par câble et le logiciel peuvent tomber en panne.\n\nLe câble peut se déconnecter.\nLe logiciel n'est pas configuré correctement.\nLe logiciel ne démarre pas.\nLes batteries de l'onduleur se dégradent (généralement dans les 2 ans suivant l'installation dans des environnements sujets aux coupures de courant) et leur capacité est insuffisante pour permettre à l'ordinateur de s'arrêter correctement après avoir reçu la notification de l'onduleur.\n\n\n\nOrdinateurs portables vs ordinateurs de bureau\nLes ordinateurs portables ont tendance à être beaucoup plus résistants aux coupures de courant :\n\nL'onduleur intelligent intégré d'un ordinateur portable est très fiable.\nLes batteries internes durent beaucoup plus longtemps que les batteries d'onduleur.\nMême si la batterie interne de l'ordinateur portable se dégrade, la fonction intelligente semble fonctionner de manière beaucoup plus fiable qu'un onduleur autonome communiquant avec un ordinateur de bureau.\n\nVoici quelques avantages supplémentaires des ordinateurs portables par rapport aux ordinateurs de bureau :\n\nCoût de transport inférieur :\n\nPour envoyer la machine sur le site.\nPour envoyer des pièces de rechange pour une réparation sur site.\nPour récupérer la machine sur site pour toute réparation qui ne peut être effectuée sur site.\n\n\nInclusion standard de fonctionnalités telles que le Wi-Fi, le Bluetooth et la caméra, ce qui n'est peut-être pas le cas des ordinateurs de bureau.\n\nLa sécurité est un point important avec les ordinateurs portables. Il est plus facile de voler un ordinateur portable dans un bureau qu'un ordinateur de bureau. C'est pourquoi les ordinateurs portables sont normalement configurés avec une fonction de verrouillage physique, telle qu'un emplacement pour verrou Kensington.\nÉtant donné qu'Open mSupply utilise beaucoup de chiffres (quantités de stock),  il est fortement recommandé d'avoir un clavier avec un pavé numérique . Les ordinateurs portables plus petits (écran de 14 pouces ou moins) n'en auront pas. Les ordinateurs portables plus petits ont généralement un écran trop petit et peu pratique. Il est donc recommandé de se procurer un ordinateur portable avec un clavier comprenant un pavé numérique, ce qui nécessitera nécessairement un écran plus grand.\nAccessoires de productivité pour ordinateurs portables\nVoici quelques accessoires de productivité utiles pour les ordinateurs portables :\n\nSouris filaire (pas sans fil - le remplacement des piles est coûteux et pose des problèmes environnementaux).\nClavier filaire (pas sans fil - le remplacement des piles est coûteux et pose des problèmes environnementaux).\nÉcran externe\n\nBande passante et latence requises🔗\nAvant de parler de bande passante et de latence, il convient de mentionner notre système de synchronisation, qui a évité des échecs d'installation dans de nombreux pays.\nMode hors ligne (synchronisation)🔗\n\nBande passante : 128 kbps\nLatence : élevée (par exemple, satellite) acceptable. Les utilisateurs ne la remarqueront pas dans les opérations quotidiennes, car la synchronisation s'effectue en arrière-plan et les demandes de données sont satisfaites à partir de la base de données locale, et non par internet.\nConnectivité : intermittente (une fois par semaine par exemple) acceptable.\n\nMode hébergé dans le cloud (en ligne)🔗\n\nTéléchargement initial : environ 1 Mo de code Javascript, une connexion de 512 kbps ou plus est donc recommandée (chargement en 10 secondes environ).\nConnexion internet requise : nécessaire pour utiliser Open mSupply dans ce mode.\nLatence : une latence élevée (par exemple, satellite ou connexion surchargée) se traduira par des performances plus lentes.\n\nSystème de sauvegarde🔗\nUne fois que vous commencez à utiliser Open mSupply, il est important d'avoir une méthode de sauvegarde de vos données. Dans une installation par défaut, Open mSupply stocke toutes ses données dans un fichier qui devient rapidement volumineux. Vous devez donc disposer d'un périphérique de stockage amovible de grande capacité. Nous recommandons vivement l'utilisation d'un disque dur externe via FireWire (IEEE 1394) ou USB2 pour faciliter le stockage hors site des sauvegardes.\n\nSi vous n'utilisez pas notre service de sauvegarde en ligne, vous devez pouvoir stocker les données sauvegardées hors site pour éviter les risques de perte dus à un incendie, un vol, etc.\n\nAntivirus🔗\nLes systèmes d'exploitation basés sur Windows sont particulièrement vulnérables aux logiciels malveillants si des précautions ne sont pas prises. Nous recommandons les précautions suivantes :\n\nInstallez un antivirus réputé, y compris une protection Web si l'ordinateur a accès à Internet.\nDésactivez les ports USB - reportez-vous à ce site: URL disable usb port windows ON Microsoft support.microsoft.com pour les méthodes suggérées.\nAssurez-vous que l'accès aux mots de passe permettant des exceptions aux deux mesures ci-dessus est sécurisé.\n\nmSupply🔗\nUne installation de mSupply est actuellement requise pour exécuter Open mSupply (elle permet de gérer un certain nombre d'aspects centralisés du système).\nLa version d'mSupply et d'Open mSupply est importante, car toutes les versions ne sont pas compatibles entre elles.\nLe tableau ci-dessous indique la version d'mSupply dont vous aurez besoin pour exécuter Open mSupply :\nOpen mSupplymSupply\n1.1.00 - 1.1.167.04.01+\n1.2.00+7.05.05+\n1.4.00+7.09.00+\n\nSi vous essayez de vous connecter à un serveur incompatible, vous obtiendrez un message d'erreur ressemblant à ceci :\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/fr/docs/introduction/requirements/","title":"Configuration requise pour Open mSupply"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/fr/docs/introduction/roadmap/":{"body":"Une mise à jour de cette feuille de route est prévue toutes les six semaines.\nElle couvre uniquement les chantiers validés en cours.

Nous utilisons Firefox, mais Chrome et d'autres fonctionnent également.\nEntrez l'adresse Web (URL) de votre serveur mSupply. Dans le cas présent, nous utilisons https://demo-open.msupply.org - notre site Web de test.\nAppuyez  sur votre clavier, la page de connexion s'affiche.\n\n\n\nEntrez votre nom d'utilisateur et votre mot de passe. Appuyez sur  sur votre clavier, ou cliquez sur le bouton [Connexion].\n\nVous êtes alors redirigé(e) vers la page du tableau de bord.\nEn cas de problème, un message d'erreur apparaît:\n\nEssayez de retaper le nom d'utilisateur et le mot de passe. Notez que les deux sont sensibles aux majuscules et minuscules (la casse).\nLorsque vous vous connectez, le dépôt par défaut de votre utilisateur est sélectionné comme dépôt courant. Si vous avez accès à d'autres dépôts, vous pourrez changer de dépôt après vous être connecté (voir ci-dessous).\nSi vous vous êtes déjà connecté, et avez changé de dépôt, alors le dépôt le plus récent sera sélectionné pour vous lors de votre re-connection.\nNaviguer dans Open mSupply🔗\nLe menu principal se trouve sur le côté gauche de l'écran. Si vous avez un petit écran, alors il sera réduit par défaut - pour les écrans plus grands, il sera élargi par défaut. Pour ouvrir et fermer, cliquez sur le logo en haut, comme indiqué ci-dessous. Le menu reste ouvert ou fermé une fois que vous avez sélectionné une option.\nSi le menu est fermé, il suffit de survoler les éléments du menu pour l'ouvrir, dans ce cas, cliquer sur un élément laisse le menu se refermer. Le résultat est le même sur tablette.\n\nSur certains écrans, va s'afficher un libellé en en-tête, tel que Expédition dans l'exemple ci-avant dessus. En cliquant sur une expédition spécifique de la liste, vous changez cet en-tête en Expédition/ #[le numéro d'expédition]. Vous pouvez cliquer sur Expédition pour retourner à la liste - ou utiliser le menu de navigation à gauche.\nRaccourcis clavier🔗\nDes raccourcis clavier peuvent être utilisés dans Open mSupply. Plutôt que de tous les mémoriser, il vous suffit de vous souvenir de la combinaison control (ctrl)+k (windows et linux) ou cmd (⌘)+k (mac)\nLa fenêtre suivante apparaît et ce, peu importe la page que vous consultez :\n\nLa liste des raccourcis disponibles s'affiche. Par exemple en tapant la lettre d de votre clavier, cela vous amènera au tableau de bord (sauf si vous saisissez du texte!).\nVous pouvez également cliquer sur un élément de la liste ou rechercher les commandes disponibles :\n\nDe plus, il existe divers endroits où des raccourcis clavier spécifiques sont disponibles, comme, par exemple, l'onglet de contrôle utilisé aussi bien pour les Inventaires que pour les Livraisons. Ici, vous pouvez utiliser control+1 pour accéder au premier onglet (Lot) ou control+2 pour le second onglet (Tarification) etc. Vous pouvez ajouter un nouveau lot en tapant la touche + de votre clavier.\n\nPied de Page🔗\nLe bas de l'écran contient des informations utiles et s'affiche sur chaque écran.\n\nCertains utilisateurs ont accès à plus d'un dépôt.

Lorsque vous avez fini de sortir du stock à partir de l'emplacement « d'émission », et vous souhaitez émettre le stock qui se trouve dans l'emplacement \"en vrac\", vous devrez soit retirer l'emplacement \"en vrac\" de l'attente, soit déplacer tout ou partie (diviser) le stock de l'emplacement \"en vrac\" vers un emplacement « d'émission ».\n\nModifier un nouvel emplacement🔗\nPour modifier un emplacement, cliquez simplement sur une ligne de la liste des emplacements. \nSupprimer un emplacement🔗\nPour supprimer un emplacement:\n\nCochez la case de l'emplacement que vous souhaitez supprimer dans la liste des emplacements\nCliquez sur le menu déroulant Sélectionner et sélectionnez Supprimer la ligne sélectionnée\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/fr/docs/inventory/locations/","title":"Emplacements"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/fr/docs/inventory/stock-takes/":{"body":"mSupply gardera automatiquement une trace de vos niveaux de stock pour vous, au fur et à mesure que vous les recevez et les distribuez.
